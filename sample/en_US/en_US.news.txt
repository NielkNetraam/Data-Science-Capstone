While learning how to perform your exercise therapy program, it's important to do whatever you need to do to control symptoms, whether it's massage, chiropractic and/or medication.

Then, finally. With 5:13 left in the game, he spotted up for a 15-foot jumper from the baseline that swished. The crowd, a little more full of Kentucky fans than Kansas, went crazy. If this guy only stays one year and only makes one shot, they're fine with that.
“There’s countless other examples of cities that have not performed well in poor quality ballparks,” Paulson said. “That’s when they’ve built new ballparks, they’ve been magnificent.”
We built a lot of systems then in risk management, so we already knew how to turn the switch and employ practices. In the recent financial crisis, we started watching our cash on a daily basis. Newer people would not know what to do because they'd never experienced anything like these events.

Evan Agostini/Associated PressDan Auerbach, singer and guitarist of the Black Keys, at Madison Square Garden last month.In a sense, the story of how the Black Keys became America's Next Arena Rock Band is easy to tell. The narrative, as it has rolled across the country this spring, goes like this: Two regular guys (singer and guitarist Dan Auerbach, drummer Patrick Carney) from a regular town (Akron, Ohio) rise up and sell out Madison Square Garden in 15 minutes, offer hope for the future of rock 'n' roll.

The board said Lariviere defied its directions by lobbying for UO in the Legislature, giving pay raises to faculty and administrators last spring and missing some board meetings.

The game hamfistedly tries to evoke classic moments from the film, with secondary objectives such as buzzing a control tower with a flyby or snapping a photo of an enemy plane. It's clear the designers loved "Top Gun" as much as any fan, but the execution doesn't do the action classic justice. Aficionados will notice the details that carry over from the film, but the feeling is one of nostalgia for the film more than excitement to play the game. Maybe there will be a downloadable beach volleyball level at some point in the future.
The balance is due partly to Missouri paying less in tax refunds than it did in the previous year. But the state also saw growth in tax collections.

Fox's pictures were what you would expect in this day and age of 40-plus HD cameras and super slow motion. The network stayed away from most fan shots (hopefully ESPN took notice), replayed most penalties quickly, and was all over the biggest plays with multiple angles. There were a couple of times I didn't see a replay I wanted, but that happened far fewer times than it does during the regular season. One negative was Pam Oliver saying Donald Driver was questionable to return to the game when a picture showed him wearing a walking boot.

Once your pop-culture legacy has cross-pollinated with the Kennedys, you're branded forever. You become inescapably embroiled in too-many-to-count conspiracy theories, sordid memoirs and bad TV movies.

Sarah Marie Johnson was 16 in 2003 when prosecutors said she shot Alan and Diane Johnson at the family’s Bellevue home.

When President Barack Obama addressed the American Society of News Editors convention last month, the real news was what didn't happen. The watchdogs didn't bark.

The Army Corps' report also notes special care will be needed to find and dispose of any cannonballs and other explosive projectiles remaining on the riverbed.
"My vision for America is very different than this president’s vision. What he’s done over the last 3 1/2 years is, is install a series of policies that have made it backbreaking for many small businesses, that have made it harder for our economy to reboot and put people back to work," Romney said.

Patsos is nothing if not a liberal user of his bench players. When I go to Reitz, I try to sit behind the home bench, which affords me the opportunity to see the coach at work. For Patsos, at work means quickly yanking players out of the game, yelling at an assistant coach about said player’s performance while the player sits next to the assistant coach, then putting the player back in a minute later.

Use all your senses: Judging beer is a science, and Pat Daniels -- one of the most knowledgeable tasters around -- offers an excellent guide: bjcp.org/docs/How_to_Judge_Beer.pdf. "All five human senses can and should be used when judging officially or casually," says Daniels, a bartender at McNulty's Bier Markt. And yes, that includes hearing: "I know what you're thinking. How can one's ears contribute to the overall beer-tasting experience? When judging or casually drinking from beer poured from the bottle, I have started the process with many styles such as a highly carbonated Belgian Gueuze and Tripel that should present the sound of massive amounts of CO2 escaping from the bottle (like popping champagne) after being opened. Unfortunately, my ears are the first to detect that such a bottle has gone flat and lost this sought-after carbonation that helps makes the style."

Maybe the problem lies not with the two political parties themselves, but who did the grading. Let’s look at some of these graders. The first one was Cumberland County Public Safety Director James Matlock. His job was at stake. Can he make a fair assessment? The next grader was a fire chief. This would have been all right if he was grading at the fire academy school, but not a 911 department head position. Two other freeholders were involved in the grading system. They certainly are going to be biased, that’s for sure. Professional staff members ... what professional staff members? This whole grading system stinks to high heaven.

Pacifica resident Howard Hall was among those who wrote to tell Fed officials how he had run up $15,000 in card debt after he lost his job in 2001, fell behind in his payments and saw his 8.9 percent rate shoot up to 29 percent - raising his monthly minimum payment to $400. Hall said he was able to climb out of debt because his wife was working and they were able to refinance their home. Now back at work, Hall asked what would happen to a single parent or someone without his advantages "once they fall into a credit death spiral."

The eatery sits on Front St., in one of the oldest buildings in the city. Completely restored and revamped by its new tenants, owners Tamer Hamawi, Elise Rosenberg, Emelie Kihlstrom, and Bradford McDonald, the vibe is simple, chic, with a touch of "Day of the Dead." Inspired by Mexican artist Jose Guadalupe Posada (the eatery is named for one of his sketches), the wallpaper boasts sketches of Brooklyn with a dark side: like the Statue of Liberty with the head of a skeleton.
In his State of the Union address, the president reiterated his goal of putting 1 million plug-in hybrids and all-electrics on the road by 2015 and insisted that Congress spend hundreds of millions of additional dollars to achieve it. Fewer than 5,000 electrics are out there, so auto companies would have to sell about a quarter of a million vehicles annually until 2015 to meet his target.
Few people understand the plight of homeless veterans the way he does. Like many of them, he served in the military. And, although he owns what he describes as a 200-acre cattle ranch in Benson, Ariz., the Dreamer lives several days each month on the street, voluntarily, in Los Angeles — in solidarity, he says, with the rootless vets he meets and in memory of his unfettered youth.

Last Friday, an emailer sent me a YouTube video and an audio file of a clip from a somewhat-obscure national talk radio show. Both purported to expose shocking facts in the labyrinthine national health care legislation that has been proposed and enacted in recent years.

I'm disappointed with the soup at many places, but here the combinations are so enticing I had to order it on each visit. The first time it was cream of asparagus teetering on the edge of rosemary overload; the second was sausage and farro with a rich tomato broth that was good but could have been absolutely lyrical with a little more restraint with the herbs. On my third visit, the soup was an exceptional black bean ($7) that took on the meaty character of the accompanying bits of chorizo with a swirl of chile cream and scallions in the center to smooth it all out.
Handing high school students $35,000 with which to play the stock market might not seem like the best way to boost a school endowment, but in 1997, that is what trustees at Flintridge Preparatory School did.

It's little wonder that L.A. voters and ratepayers, most of whom can only dream of getting the gold-plated retirement packages and high salaries that are awarded to DWP workers, resent the City Council's frequent votes to raise utility rates. They were hit again Wednesday when the council approved a 2.9% hike for water rates, and even steeper annual increases are planned for the next three years. Yet for all the justified populist outrage, there's still a genuine need to raise DWP rates. DWP salaries are built into the utility's operating expenses, but the current rate hikes are needed to pay rising capital costs connected with higher prices for water and electricity, meeting federal and state standards for drinking water and switching to renewable power. Failure to approve the rate increases could result in fines costing ratepayers more than the increases.
U.S. software companies say they fear China's proposed policy would cost them billions in sales. Government purchases represent about 40 percent of the Chinese economy.

For San Diego's Dick Enberg, one of the more productive and insightful figures in sports broadcasting, it's been a long road, but not a winding one. Since his youth in Armada, Mich.

Raised in a farmhouse without plumbing, educated in a one-room school house, Enberg hitchhiked to his first day of college at Central Michigan. It didn't take him long to get to the head of the class.

The handheld tone chimes are played with a snapping motion, followed by dampening on the opposite shoulder. It's a simple action involving many skills a stroke survivor may be working on improving.
The qualified endorsements by Anthony Wieners and Ed Brannigan, who represent more than 49,000 officers between them, could add momentum to calls for expanded testing following a series of Star-Ledger reports last week showing hundreds of law enforcement officers and firefighters obtained steroids and human growth hormone from a doctor who often prescribed them illegally.

"We take big bets," Viswanathan said. "We're about changing not just the company, but changing the industry. Big things require big risks."
PETA officials told the paper investigators attended racing in New York and other states where birds were awarded "points" for flying home the fastest. The "points" were actually prizes, PETA officials claimed. The group also said gambling on the birds was rampant in multiple locations.

The conservative Heritage Foundation says the source of the nation's budget crisis "is bipartisan. Generations of politicians from both political parties have invited millions of Americans into greater dependence on the government, promising expensive services without regard to cost."
Nutrition directors at school districts in Washington County say the federal government shouldn't pick on the potato -- or any vegetable, for that matter. It's the preparation method that should be addressed.
Moss has been working out in the mornings with position mate Michael Crabtree, safety Donte Whitner and running back Frank Gore, who didn't participate in Thursday's on-field practice.

“So many of us play -- at church, at family parties. We’re closet virtuosos,” Osgood said. “I want to create a venue for amateur players to perform.”
That’s why game-breaking wide receiver Markus Wheaton probably won’t be on the field for long. If Wheaton went down with a significant injury, Oregon State would be wise to petition for admission into the WAC.
Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama also differ on Medicaid. Mr. Romney wants to change Medicaid funding from an open-ended entitlement to a block grant system, thereby limiting the federal government's exposure to health care costs. The Affordable Care Act, on the other hand, expands Medicaid to 17 million more low-income Americans, at a cost to states and the federal government.

To help relieve your symptoms, antihistamines that can be bought over-the-counter are available in eye drops, nasal sprays and oral medications in pill or liquid form. Decongestants can help relieve a stuffy nose. Your doctor may prescribe higher-dose medications if your symptoms persist. If those remedies don't work, immunotherapy is the next step - allergy shots.
The Timbers acquired Perkins in a trade that sent Steve Cronin (and allocation money) to D.C. United Dec. 17. The move was a mild surprise, considering Cronin was among the first four players the team signed to MLS contracts. But the opportunity to acquire Perkins, considered one of the top goalkeepers in the league after his first stint with D.C. United, was too good for the Timbers to pass up.
Small businesses should have the opportunity to fund their own health plan, said Scott Hauge, president of Small Business California, but he also shares regulators' concerns that costs could increase for small business owners who remain in the regular market.
Carlisle and the Mavericks were frustrated long before that.

It's a valid point, especially in the No. 4-No. 5 Western Conference pairing in which the Wings find themselves against the Predators. They were 3-3 in regular-season matchups and just two points separated them in the final standings. But it can't be ignored that the intimidation the Wings once enjoyed even before they took the ice during playoff time has dissipated.
“People think I’m young, but I’m 42, and I’ve experienced everything you can in this game,” he said.
"Employees call us and complain that they feel like they don't have a choice, and unfortunately, they don't. If an employee refuses to work over a holiday, he or she could be legally terminated.

Yes, it was another hour of interviews for the Giants’ players after answering questions for 60 minutes at Lucas Oil Stadium a day prior. And Eli Manning pretty much summed up the situation when he said in his first answer, “Nothing has changed between Media Day and today.”
"Given recent events, the public's trust in the Coliseum's operations has been seriously eroded and allowing the City Controller full and open access to its books will be a step in the right direction," Caruso wrote.
Heat the pan, then grease it. Most recipes call for medium-high to high heat. Get the pan hot before adding the oil or butter. There should be enough to coat the bottom but not so much that the batter swims in it.

Groomer Sheri Harvey of Sheri's Pampered Pets in Chester Township, N.J., says few owners take her up on the offer to put a star, flower, rainbow or other design on their pet. That's because many pet owners are unfamiliar with the practice and are fearful the dyes could injure their pets, Harvey says.
Other changes may be coming too as the National Park Service considers overhauling management of the iconic granite dome, which rises nearly 5,000 feet above Yosemite Valley. Thousands each year make the grueling trek to the top, aided by a 400-foot-long cable system in place during warmer months.

The wildly (and deservedly) popular Sunset Grille is here. A sprawling waterside expanse of dining rooms and decks, the upscale restaurant is impeccably operated and managed, a pleasure to visit. Nearby, the homier Harborside Bar & Grille, famous for its orange "crushes," attracts locals and visitors alike. It was a Harborside bartender who made sure I stopped by the Shark at the Harbor, local-food champion that moved across the bay a few years ago, and tipped me off to what turned out to be my favorite stop of the weekend, the one-of-a-kind Shrimp Boat, a roadside wonder that Joe Crochetti started over 20 years ago.
A healthier job market and warmer weather encouraged more Americans to shop in March.
Sept. 11, 2009: The Navy Veterans complains to the Times that the newspaper has been trying to "elicit negative information" about the non-profit. The charity announces that henceforth, no one at the Navy Veterans will speak to anyone at the newspaper. It says all communications now must go through the Navy Veterans' attorney, Helen Mac Murray in Ohio.
Both observers also highlighted the division between the center (big downtown performing arts venues, gleaming commercial galleries) and the fringe (out-of-the-way theaters, funky alternative exhibit space). Hicks essentially praised the arts scene here for continuing to do more and more with a little, but wonders if the broader community will appreciate that enough to help out. Plagens seemed to suggest that there’s an inherent contradiction in Portland’s indie-minded ethos and its unspoken ambition (“To be blunt, Portland's art scene has a lot of no-no on its lips but yes-yes in its eyes”).
The expansion plan authored for the museum by New York architect Rafael Vinoly called for demolition of additions built in 1958 and 1983 in the center of the museum complex.
Buffett has said he remains in good health, and has no plans to retire because he enjoys running the conglomerate he built.
Some of the songs seem instantly familiar. The central riff of “It’s a Shame,” for instance, got recycled in the “Darkness” track “Streets of Fire.” “Come On (Let’s Go Tonight)” has the same melody as “Factory” and a line that would later show up, in slightly modified form, in “Out in the Street” (“Put on your black dress, baby/And put your hair up right”).
"We truly have lost our church and we know that. Most of us are in mourning," said Anne Waltz, a member since 1956 who still attends a Sunday morning bible study class with other seniors. "A lot of my friends still can't believe it's happening."

Last Monday, detective division Cmdr. Ed Brumfield ordered all Central Precinct officers to fill out special reports, asking that they account for where they stored their duty bags the week of the June 30 shooting, what type of ammo they had stored in their bags and how they kept the lethal versus less-lethal rounds, such as in a manufacturer's box, evidence or plastic bag. The order -- which followed an earlier, unsuccessful voluntary request -- is to "identify any training and/or performance deficiencies," Brumfield wrote.

He admitted the affair in 2008 after dropping out of the presidential race, but did not admit to being the child's father until January 2010. That month, Elizabeth Edwards announced she was separating from her husband.
And because he gives a fair chance to everything he’s sent, no matter how humble the packaging looks, his show has become required listening for anybody interested in the New York City underground. While Russo plays cuts by major label acts — he was the first deejay in the country to spin Pearl Jam’s 2009 single "Just Breathe" — his heart belongs to the true independent artists. Russo is community-minded, and he takes his commitment to airing music alternatives seriously. While he didn’t initially know how to transform that mission into action on "Anything Anything," he feels like he’s now on the right track.
Although pikas are well-known to hikers along high, rocky slopes in several flagship national parks, including Yellowstone, Glacier and Yosemite, population studies have been sporadic across their range.

Context: The sweet fruit and soft tannins of the cabernet franc make it one of those rare red wines that can be sipped just on its own, though it also has the spine to stand up to barbecued tri-tip, grilled chicken with a berry sauce, or braised pork with a salsa built on pineapple and orange.
øIf you're a handy sort and converted your vehicle to a qualified plug-in vehicle last year, you're eligible for tax credit worth up to 10% of the conversion cost, up to a maximum credit of $4,000, says Helen O'Planick, an enrolled agent in Manchester, Pa. That credit expired at the end of 2011.

“The great thing about Chicago is that, if you really want to be an actor, you can be an actor,” he says. “There are so many opportunities that, even if you have to have a day job to keep going, you can still be onstage that night. In New York, you can really want to be an actor, you can say you’re an actor, but still be a waiter. … Also, New York’s an extremely competitive, dog-eat-dog world. Chicago has some of that big-city feeling, but you don’t feel like you’re going to perish on the street if you don’t keep moving.”

The weight of a franchise sits on the shoulders of this 6-foot-4, 230-pound first baseman. He is a 22-year-old who must act like a veteran. But listen to those who know Hosmer best, and you realize he's been doing so his whole life.
Mauer could move to first base or designated hitter to reduce the stress on the knee. He might be motivated even more to stay in the lineup: He's a career .385 hitter at Angel Stadium with four homers and 15 RBI in 25 games.
Some pastors who lead Spanish-speaking ministries in the county aren't heeding the pastor group's call, but they haven't broached the subject with their congregants either.
Other findings from the European study suggest that parental characteristics, such as age, make a difference in well-being. Those who become parents at younger ages have a downward happiness trend, while postponing parenthood results in a higher happiness level after the birth. However, co-author Rachel Margolis of the University of Western Ontario in London, Ontario, says the risk of involuntary childlessness increases with age.
On most financial issues Arroyo showed little depth, both on his questionnaire and in person. He said all pension obligations must be paid first and said "I'm dead set against eliminating anyone's pension," though that has not been proposed. Arroyo, who lost his airline pension, also is open to borrowing to pay off the state's bills.

Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony renewed their wedding vows in Las Vegas over the weekend. We hope it works out better than the last time Anthony renewed his wedding vows ... remember, with former Miss Universe Dayanara Torres? And they got divorced a year and a half later? And he married Lopez four days later?
It was President Barack Obama who ordered the daring raid on bin Laden's walled compound in Pakistan. It was a risky call. Some of Obama's top advisers, including Vice President Joe Biden, warned against it. The mission could have been a disaster — let us count the ways — in which case the anniversary would have been marked by Republican TV spots clubbing Obama for his poor foreign policy decisions.
The officer was talking with a dancer outside a go-go bar around 3 a.m. when the suspect reached for the woman's purse, according a a report on the WABC-7 website. The officer was shot after trying to stop the suspect, the report said. After shooting the officer, the person fled on foot.
Four years have passed since Dustin Clark took over the Wildwood kitchen from founder Cory Schreiber, and the taciturn chef has made subtle changes to the menu while preserving some tinker-at-your-own-risk standards such as the skillet-roasted Manila clams and the potato-crusted Dungeness crab cakes.
"Ordinarily from that distance, you just try to pound it in there four times, but if we would have done that, we wouldn't have had enough time," Russell said. "If we hadn't have got it in in two, we would have had to ground the ball and decide whether to kick a field goal and play overtime."

Assemblywoman Nancy Munoz, Summit Mayor Ellen Dixon, Council President Rich Madden, candidate Al Dill Jr. and Assemblyman Jon Bramnick all appeared at the fair.
We already have quite a bit of data about what happens when intensive interventions attempt to improve activity levels and nutrition for the purposes of producing weight loss. Activity levels and nutrition improve; meanwhile, weight is not lost. This is because we don't know how to make people thinner. If you're going to indulge in the fiction that saying we should do something somehow makes it possible to do it, I'm going to indulge in the fiction that pointing out a fact over and over again to people who don't want to acknowledge it will somehow cause them to eventually acknowledge it.
The Gophers will have only 12 seniors on scholarship next season, so it's possible that they could have only 12 scholarships to hand out next February. It likely will be more than that -- "There's always some natural attrition every year," Kill said, "so we may still end up with 16 or 17" -- but there is little chance that Kill and his staff will sign 27 scholarship athletes, as they did in February, or even the 23 they brought in a year before.

When then-junior Sen. Barack Obama came to the University of Denver in 2008, the Democratic presidential hopeful was greeted by long lines and a crowd full of youthful enthusiasm. And while his return to the state for tonight's appearance at the University of Colorado at Boulder more than four years later has produced similarly long waits for tickets, the other response — enthusiasm — is lurching along.
Oregon will return running backs, senior Kenjon Barner, De’Anthony Thomas, Tra Carson and Ayele Forde. But that doesn’t prevent Marshall from expecting to contribute as a freshman.

I started it several years ago, to give me an outlet/deadline for my work, and to move me from being a theoretical writer to an actual one. Even as I place more and more stories in other outlets, it's still a forum to write about things that are of personal interest, and to tell and understand the little stories of my own life.
As of yesterday evening, Echavarria’s bail had not been set. Police said he would be arraigned in Hudson County Superior Court.
A bill introduced in the New Jersey legislature two weeks ago by Sens. Paul Sarlo of Bergen County and Raymond Lesniak of Union County would require online retailers like Amazon to collect sales taxes if they have a presence in the state.

No pass interference on Guyton on RB D.J. Ware on a third down in the third quarter? I know he grabbed Ware’s towel and, according to Aikman, that’s not a penalty. But I also thought he got some jersey and impeded Ware’s progress.
Through the years of the Handbook one of the easiest players to predict each season has to be Albert Pujols. There's a reason why ESPN had him standing at a Xerox machine for his commercial. The back of his baseball card consists of a Topps intern going ctrl-A, ctrl-C, ctrl-V 11 times over. It's no different for 2012. Despite the much-publicized downward trends for the $250-million man, Pujols is still predicted to hit his marks: .316/.414/.591 with a 1.005 OPS, 41 homers and 120 RBIs. James' predictions, of course, veer beyond the standard stats. The Handbook projects that Pujols will have 144 runs created (RC) and
"I saw a pretty big void as far as job-seeking," he said.
"We expected his best and we knew he had been hurt, but when we watched film, he still looked great," senior lineman Tyson Urrutia said. "Those pursuit drills we had been working on the last three weeks have really paid off."
Said Cavaliers coach Byron Scott, who started alongside multiple MVP winners Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar with the Los Angeles Lakers, "I don't think they thought about the MVP at all. What those guys thought about was the championship. An MVP was an added bonus. If they won the MVP and we didn't win the championship than they thought the season was a loss.

Q: All this talk about the Heat needing a stud sixth man, or at least some solid scoring off the bench, could, of course, be solved by using the same guy who brilliantly did so for Team USA in the 2008 Olympics: Dwyane Wade. -- Shep.
Don't work past pain. Some people who have been lifelong competitors start to see joint issues, Jacobson said, especially those who have focused solely on one sport. If you do have pain, take a proactive approach, she said, and seek out a personal trainer or physical therapist. "You need to find out the underlying reason," she said. Skipping strength-training, she said, can exacerbate the problem.

With grilling season in full swing, steak and burger fans are looking for bold red wines that will stand up to big, juicy meats. When I think of beef, I often think of Argentina.

In October 2009, Judge Ellen Maas awarded $4.2 million in sanctions against BNSF, on top of the jury verdict, saying the railroad had engaged in a "staggering" pattern of misconduct aimed at covering up its role in the deaths of the four people in the car. In her ruling, Maas found, among other things, that the railroad destroyed a computer disc that recorded the train's speed and failed to disclose its awareness of previous problems at the intersection.

Last year, Spirit made a profit of $76.4 million, and one-third of its operating revenue was from its fees for carry-on and checked bags, choosing seats in advance and extra legroom.

I havent heard from Detroit, but that dont mean anything, Gilmore said. I talked to them a lot at the combine. I didnt talk to them none after that, but that dont mean nothing because most of the teams that dont talk to you end up drafting you.

Not knowing exactly what would fit for my family. So for a while there, I couldn't leave any dropped fruit. Anything anybody had on a tree, I was there to rescue it. There was one year where -- it was the first year -- I made tons and tons of plum jam. It was like "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof." It was the hottest day of the year. I didn't have my outdoor kitchen yet. I was in my slip. That does not look like Blanche DuBois. That looks like Harriet Fasenfest in a slip. With gray hair. I didn't even like the jam. So it was learning there's a logic to it. You know, we approach it as fashion as opposed to being about form and function. The way we do it, everybody rushes to do food preservation or get chickens, but you really have to incorporate or understand it in the larger context of your life. So that was my biggest mistake. Making things my family really didn't want to eat.

The charm of this production is not so much in the story it tells as in the way it is told. Tracey Maloney's Vasa Lisa seems a wide-eyed waif at first, but as the play progresses she develops into a steely protagonist more than capable of taking on the villains who surround her. And what a crew of villains they are. Jim Lichtscheidl creates the penultimate evil stepmother, coyly prancing and posturing in red heels and a fright wig. Elise Langer offers an impressively elastic series of facial expressions as the stepsister. Luverne Seifert ranges from comically crass as Vasa Lisa's parent to creepily sinister as the predatory Sir Van Franzen, The Terrible. Scuttling like a spider across the stage, Sally Wingert conjures a Baba Yaga who's every child's worst nightmare of a witch.

"If this was an island with nobody living on it, overwash wouldn’t be a bad thing," says Connors. "But there are thousands and thousands of homes here and this area is a tremendous asset to the state and federal government. It’s one thing to say, ‘People shouldn’t have moved there in the first place.’ Look, they’re here. I’m the first one to preach that the government is too big and they ought to cut back but Long Beach Island deserves whatever assistance the government can give and this government has given quite a bit of assistance and we’re very thankful to them."

By now, Brewster has started 36 games, 12 more than any other current Buckeye. He's the first-team center on nearly every preseason All-American team, always the only Ohio State player on any first-team list and almost always the only Big Ten offensive player. Brewster, of course, said he wants to be a postseason All-American, not a preseason All-American. That's when he'll also have to find out if he was a captain, since Fickell said players will vote at the end of the year.
"But people still think we fixed the Ewing lottery, so I guess nothing surprises me," Litvin said.

Lobbyists have long been known in California as the Third House, referring to their entrenched status alongside the Legislature's two official houses, the Assembly and Senate. But through interviews with current and former legislators and aides, as well as lobbyists and outside government experts, the Mercury News documented a changed pattern: Today, lobbyists function almost as a shadow legislature, pulling the strings at every turn for short-term lawmakers who have become accustomed to letting private interests monopolize the public debate. At the center of this reality is the sponsored bill.
At the same time, union and shipping industry leaders — along with some elected officials — say the commission is little more than a regulatory roadblock whose time has passed.

For Hathaway, the chance to work with Gyllenhaal and director Ed Zwick was a major part of the film's appeal. Their collaboration proved fruitful, with two leads both garnering Golden Globe nominations for "Love & Other Drugs." (The awards were handed out Jan. 16, after Inside Jersey went to press.) But professional interest and accolades aside, Hathaway identified with the message of the film, hidden beneath the sexy pyrotechnics and broad comedy.

I am enchanted with the freckles romaine lettuces in my garden. They taste a little sweet and have tender textures. But probably more than anything, I love the way they look: apple-green leaves dotted with burgundy splotches. Hearts of romaine, cut in half lengthwise and arranged cut-side up, are a good substitute. As for the dressing, it is my late mother's blue cheese vinaigrette recipe. That dressing is one of the first things I learned to "cook" (I was so small I had to stand on a stool to reach the butcher block). Here, I augment the dressing with kumquat slices from the espaliered tree in my yard.

I called Hospice of the East Bay and for the last two days of his life, they helped him to be more comfortable.

Hospice is a wonderful option and I am so glad that they were available to us.

The first film in 14 years from writer-director Whit Stillman ("Barcelona," "The Last Days of Disco") is a slight piece of work, but agreeably peculiar. The damsels of the title are New England college coeds who make it their mission to uplift their campus' male barbarians and do some good for humankind. Violet (Greta Gerwig) leads the young ladies into volunteer service at the campus Suicide Prevention Center, where they offer doughnuts, tap dance lessons and scented soaps to the forlorn visitors. The film skewers Violet's cockeyed do-gooderism, but we never question her sincerity. Rated PG-13; mature themes, some sexual content. 1 hour, 39 minutes. By Colin Covert, Star Tribune (Minneapolis).

Much of the small talk at 1666 Coffman probably resembles that in any retirement community: chitchat about the weather and current events, and what other tenants are up to. But in a complex whose residents have spent their lives immersed in physics, economics, chemistry, medicine, veterinary medicine, mathematics, English, history, archeology and other fields, conversations may get a bit more rarefied.

Others were trying to uphold the right to an accredited education, by making the law workable for receiving districts.

A: The Columbia Generating Station, the Northwest's only nuclear power reactor, was built 15 years after the Japanese reactors and unlike them includes a system that can keep cooling the reactor core even after a total loss of power. When the tsunami knocked out backup generators in Japan, the reactor cooling system failed, causing the disastrous overheating of fuel. If electricity fails at the Columbia Generating Station, workers can run the cooling system on steam power. The plant also has three backup diesel generators, each with enough fuel to produce electricity for seven days, said Mike Paoli, a spokesman for Energy Northwest, the company that runs the reactor. If all three generators fail, Paoli said, the plant has battery backup that can maintain cooling for 8 hours at a stretch, between rechargings by a portable diesel generator.

All of these factors undermine the credibility of the government's threatened response to large cyberattacks.

The lottery's cruelest turn for the Suns came in 2007 when they were going to get Atlanta's pick to complete a trade as long as the lottery did not put Atlanta in the top three, where the pick was protected from the 2005 Joe Johnson trade.

Those of us who have long advocated that the U.S. put some muscle into its diplomacy -- even bomb Syrian military installations and impose a no-fly zone -- have to concede the difficulties entailed. The Syrian air-defense system is thick, designed by the Russians to deter an Israeli attack. The composition of the Syrian opposition is largely unknown (to quote Butch Cassidy: "Who are those guys?"). More worrisome, Syria has a vast stockpile of chemical and biological weapons. They have not been used -- they're hard to control -- but a regime fighting for its life may well use everything at its disposal. Saddam did.

The comic actor's Web talk-show parody makes its prime-time debut at 8:30 tonight, right before the Comedy Central Comedy Awards. Tina Fey and Jon Stewart will appear as the straight-faced guests, who always leave dazed, confused and often furious at the experience. In the past, Galifianakis has sneezed on Jon Hamm and prompted Ben Stiller to walk off early and punch the cheap cable-access-style set. Classic moment: When Galifianakis played an audio clip of Stiller's then-new movie "Greenberg" and the star asked why not use a video clip, the host replied, "Too much trouble." Can Galifianakis successfully adapt his often-raunchy online series for a cable special? Stay tuned.

The nerd who taxed working people's pensions as a matter of fairness is backing a guy with an eight-digit annual income but who pays only a 15% rate to the IRS. Working people who make $35,000 a year pay 25% in federal taxes.
Freddie Mac said borrowers would have paid an average of 0.7% of the loan balance in upfront lender fees and discount points to obtain the 30-year loan, and 0.6% for the other types of mortgages. Borrowers who shop around or pay additional discount points to their lender often can find lower rates than those in the Freddie Mac survey.
To get a good indication of which way to go, add the deductions for mortgage interest and property taxes and compare that with the standard deduction. If you purchased a home late last year, itemizing this time around might not make sense. But if the numbers are close, determine whether you can itemize certain ownership costs and special circumstances to lower tax liability come April 17. Of course, other nonhome expenses also can figure in the decision.
Rounding out the cacophony is an installation of tiny images of flowers and other plant life pinned to the wall. Lifted from Martha Stewart Living magazine, the images outline the letters of a common obscenity for the reproductive act. It’s clear that Westergren is intent on holding oppositions in tension — innocence and squalor, fertility and cruelty — but these big ideas seem to have gotten away from her.
The fire was reported around 2:15 p.m., and fire crews arrived on the scene four minutes later to find a garage with extensive black smoke billowing from the building and flames showing on the outside of the structure.
The harsh measures follow two years of severe income losses, repeated tax hikes and retirement age increases that failed to signally improve the country's finances. Unemployment is at a record high of 21 percent — with more than a million people out of work — while the economy is in its fifth year of recession and is expected to contract up to 5 percent in 2012.
James also said the union did not have a lawyer for its dealings with the foundation and questioned why the foundation needs one.
But next year isn’t just about the QBs. Before injuring his knee, South Carolina running back Marcus Lattimore was definitely a candidate to be 2013's top pick. If he can get back to pre-injury form, Lattimore's combination of excellent strength, elite playing speed and elusiveness will put him in the conversation.
And if wouldnt stun anybody if that offensive trend continues Friday with the Lions once again investing a high draft pick in a running back.
"It's nice, but at the same time, we told him to keep the same hat size," Gibson said. "I always worry about stuff like that."
"The whole thing has become a mess and will certainly keep risk assets shackled in the short term, on the premise that there is a real possibility that Greece may vote against the revised bailout and austerity and subsequently find themselves having to fund their massive deficit," Stan Shamu of IG Markets in Melbourne said in a report.
The treatment of Seamus remains so worrisome to the Romney campaign that Ann Romney was compelled to say just the other day that Seamus "loved" being up in that carrier during that trip.
Even more disturbing were the stories told by several Geauga residents from other streets, also speaking at the trustees meeting, who had suffered similar treatment when their streets got on County Engineer Phillips’ list of streets to be “improved.” Horror tales of ruthless cutting of large, old trees were made even worse by the cavalier treatment given homeowners who questioned the county’s plan. It was as if a feudal lord pillaged the rural countryside and the peasants had no say in the matter.
In 2007, voters in Henry County easily approved a special-purpose local-option sales tax to help address road needs. However, that was before the economic downturn.
Total shareholder return, which includes dividends and any increase in the price of a company's stock, improved only slightly as the median rose from 21 percent in 2009 to 23 percent in 2010.

"I was really put out by that," she said. "I believe every student should have the ability to be part of a more challenging course." Last year, about 42 percent of East Noble graduates took an AP exam, roughly double the percentage three years before. But the 14 percent of graduates who earned a passing score (close to the state average) was about the same as before. Indiana's statewide goal is 25 percent of graduates earning AP credit.

I worry that we are so polarized politically that we don't reach across the aisle anymore. The thing that made me want to cry was the response I got from the blacks I was walking with. Over and over, middle-aged African-Americans would say 'Thanks for coming." It really touched me that such a small act could mean so much to them.
The 2010 AL MVP battled injuries last season and had sports hernia surgery in November.

While that might be true on an industrial scale, where the cotton can be watered and fertilized on the specific schedule required by these particular plants, it doesn't work so well under conditions where the farmers rely only on rainwater. As a result, the small scale farmers experienced lower yields than they had enjoyed when they used their own saved seed.
A lifelong cinephile, Banning, who grew up in Washington, D.C., started a film society at the University of Wisconsin to pay for grad school in English literature.

As distasteful as the revelations are, the trial has actually raised the level of debate in the race. It's pushed the candidates to stand on issues, not politics. This has been especially true because the county Democratic Party failed to endorse a candidate in December.
Medicare may be a different story. "Senior citizens are always worried about the future of Medicare," he said. "You can move voters over 55 based on those concerns."
With many urban denizens out of town for the holiday, or barbecuing in their backyards, you may even snag a Saturday night table at a top-tier restaurant or seats to a popular show.

Even the blended system, however, is highly dependent on federal funds. The plan assumes that the feds will kick in $41.9 billion, or nearly two-thirds of the cost  even though there's no money of that magnitude in the pipeline and the Republican-controlled House of Representatives has declared war on the White House's bullet train plans.
For most movie fans, a Spielberg film is technically flawless, with a great deal of heart thrown in for good measure. Too much heart, some would say, because they think Spielberg's movies occasionally slip from moving to schlocky, with the director manipulating emotions, going so far overboard to make his work resonate with family-friendly messages that he dilutes the material. Others think he is a master at providing audiences with unforgettable images and stories, combining the two in stirring fashion.

The Ameren Electric utility, much smaller in size than the ExxonMobil giant, gets rumors too: of impending summer storms, severe winter storms, flooding, year around wind and tree damage. We have seen the predictions of these disasters to occur time after time this past year. As costs mount for these natural problems, the utility looks to raise the price of their services, but any and all rate increases have to be reviewed first by an public utility commision. It seems the rate increases are always challenged, finally (maybe) awarded, but modified, after many months of hasseling and arbitration. Remember that the billing by the electric company comes after usage (payment by many customers is delayed, or not paid at all, and has to be worked out ); with the gasoline companies, you pay up front, cash or credit, before you get the product
Most of the tours in Napa inevitably focus on red wine - it is Cabernet country, after all - but white wine lovers will warm to a visit up Spring Mountain to Stony Hill.

It may be a new speed record for a government initiative. Last fall the White House issued the "Green Button" challenge to U.S. utilities: provide customers with easy, secure access to their usage data in a standard format. It only took three months for the first utilities to meet the challenge and now 17 utilities have implemented the Green Button or plan to do so. Today, EnergyAi™ announced that large and small businesses are already using their Green Button data to reduce energy use, costs, and greenhouse gas emissions.

REGAL GARDEN GROVE STADIUM 16
A world-class museum in Newark? You better believe it. The Newark Museum is home to 80 galleries of collections, including American, Asian, African and classical. It’s come a long way from the days when it consisted of two galleries at the top of the Newark Public Library; the museum, which celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2009, now consists of eight buildings. There is a beautiful sculpture garden, a shop and a café. Current exhibitions include "Tsongkhapa: The Life of a Tibetan Visionary" and "Posing Beauty: African American Images from the 1890s to the Present." A must-visit? Don’t take my word for it; Smithsonian Magazine described the museum as "the place where Shangri-la and New Jersey meet … its diverse community and treasures from Tibet to Timbuktu make the Newark Museum a little corner of paradise." Among the Saturday offerings: Youth Outreach for Performing Arts and Technology (YOPAT), comprised of Newark public school students, will perform a Motown music review; jazz singer Antoinette Montague; and Jersey City-based dance troupe Nimbus Dance Works. Open noon to 5 p.m. Wednesday through Sunday; Admission is $10, $6 for children, students and seniors. Free admission on Saturday.

Its popularity was hardly a given when National Lampoon publisher Matty Simmons followed through on a notion to use the humor magazine as the foundation for a movie.

White House spokesmen, fresh from championing the "reset" in relations with Moscow, carefully played down the illegals' arrests as a minor irritant.

So lawmakers will waste time debating and passing resolutions criticizing the federal government. When much of the nation's growth depends on immigrants, they'll debate making English the state's official language. They'll decry abortions, then do nothing to actually reduce the incidence of unintended pregnancies.

Foote learned a great deal from working with actors of this caliber, and he gave much to them in return. Not surprising for a writer so faithful to a traditional well-rounded sense of character, Foote came to playwriting via acting. After studying at the Pasadena Playhouse theater school in the '30s, he moved to New York, where he became a founding member of the American Actors Company. It was there that the dancer and choreographer Agnes de Mille, who had been doing improvisational exercises with him, encouraged him to pursue writing. Quickly, Foote's ability as a dramatist overshadowed his ability as a performer, but he never forgot that the heart of the theatrical experience is the flesh-and-blood actor willing to expose all for our collective enlightenment.

Since then, lawmakers have fought over how to pay for the extension, with Democrats seeking a surtax on incomes over $1 million and Republicans insisting on spending cuts. The public, though, seemed to have little patience for this debate. When House Republicans balked at a two-month extension just before Christmas, the blowback was so severe that they reversed themselves and accepted the deal. And memories of that drubbing apparently prompted their concession this week. Although they still insist that extensions in unemployment benefits and Medicare payment rates be paid for with spending cuts, they've dropped that demand for the payroll tax cut.

There is more bad news in these demographics for the regime. They appear to repeat the dynamics of successful post-authoritarian democratic modernization sketched in the writings of Samuel Huntington, Daniel Bell and Seymour Martin Lipset: After a period of record economic performance, a hugely expanded middle class is no longer content to enjoy unprecedented personal freedom and prosperity and wants to have political liberty and a say in governing.

Our cassatedi workshop went well. I brought my good pans and he didn't lose his temper. (Oops.) They were ridiculously easy to make, though credit the hot roll mix for that. (Yes, I caved on that part too.) But at least we wound up with more than 20, not two.
"This is one of the days when I'm proud to be from San Francisco," said Daniel Powers, 29, who started drinking at 6:30 a.m. "The fact they want to take away this 100-year tradition that started out to lift spirits from the earthquake, I think is garbage."
"What if?" the child thinks.
Nobody ever made a viral video about Thomas Lubanga. Unlike Joseph Kony, a similarly despicable African warlord who also recruited child soldiers to carry out a campaign of rape, murder and mutilation and is now the subject of the fastest-spreading video in Internet history, Lubanga's dirty work went largely unnoticed in the West. Also unlike the still-at-large Kony, Lubanga is about to face justice for his crimes.

A ruling this week that said cities could not ban dispensaries is expected to be taken up by the state high court, which already has agreed to review four other lower court decisions on medical marijuana. Once the state Supreme Court agrees to review a case, it is considered pending, and the lower court ruling cannot be cited as precedent.
In her bracing debut novel, "Threats," Los Angeles transplant Amelia Gray writes one of the most gorgeously clinical paragraphs about a blackhead you'll likely ever read. The description is somewhere between a David Attenborough nature documentary, soft-core pornography and David Cronenberg's 1986 movie "The Fly." Here are a few choice lines regarding the blackhead's existence and its extraction by a skilled facialist:
Yosemite National Park has long been on the list of places my husband and I wanted to go. After a little research, we learned that it is about a 10-hour drive to the south entrance, something doable by car.

While his story has appeared in newspapers and websites around the world, OR-7 has yet to find a mate or even settle down since following his natural inclination to leave his home and head out on his own.
THOMAS: Potentially, given that he had knowledge of his tenant's undocumented status and still chose to rent to him. However, harboring is not defined under the state statute. Even under federal law, harboring is not defined by Congress and federal courts have struggled to find a universal definition. Here we are dealing with a state statute that has yet to be interpreted by Arizona state courts. It is not clear whether the intent of the Arizona Legislature was to attach liability to landlords who knowingly rent to undocumented individuals. The other issue is that the landlord must have been doing so while in violation of another law. The landlord seems too far removed from the underage drinking violation here, but that statute is so broad that the landlord may have a problem for violating any other "criminal offense" such as failing to file taxes.
Frank, the CSU president, said no state Forest Service employees have been fired or disciplined for their handling of the controlled burn that jumped its perimeter on March 26. However, the state has already received nine notices of intended lawsuits over the fire.

More recent thinking tends to absolve the hull plates, noting that the ones seen on the ocean floor seem plenty bent — not shattered. Some metallurgists now suspect some of the 3 million rivets that went into the ship’s construction. Examples recovered from the ocean floor show very uneven quality and many popped heads. If the “poor rivet” theory is accurate, then the iceberg’s impact caused these metal bolts to snap, zippering open the hull’s seams.

Ochsner went to McKay High School and Salem Academy before studying secondary education at George Fox College in Newberg. Part of the English component was a creative-writing class, and she says Ed Higgins, the instructor, tricked the students into writing short stories by telling them to pretend to have characters and then put them in a scene. Before they knew it, they were writing a story. She loved it and wanted to study writing after graduating from George Fox but knew she didn't have the skills.
There was something of the second wife about the Ravens — something younger, sexier and harder-edged about them than the dear old Colts. Some of that was just part and parcel of how the NFL itself had changed over the years in which it had denied Baltimore a team, how it had gotten much more big-money and glitzy spectacle.

Brady noted Kiwanuka’s presence for his offensive linemen right before the now-infamous flinch. He did it often that day, as Kiwanuka did a lot of leaning up to the line in the “A” gap (between guard and center) before the snap to show pressure. Sometimes he blitzed (13 times from his linebacker spot on passing plays, to be exact) and sometimes he dropped into coverage, including on a play that resulted in an interception after linebacker Michael Boley tipped the ball.

NOTES: The Flyers didn't make any lineup changes. The Devils did. With Kovalchuk returning, New Jersey sat defenseman Peter Harrold, who had played in all nine previous playoff games. The old Devils' record for two fastest playoff goals was 26 seconds by Petr Sykora and Bobby Holik on May 14, 2000, at Philadelphia in the Eastern Conference Finals. That Devils team won the Stanley Cup. Flyers C Sean Couturier sustained a lower-body injury in the first period and did not return. The crowd of 17,625 was a sellout. Devils rookie defenseman Adam Larsson, 19, who scored in his playoff debut in Game 2, remained in the lineup. Brodeur will turn 40 on Sunday, in time for Game 4.

There are, of course, other challenges that face these places beyond coming to an agreement on immigration issues. The median household income here, about $34,000, is a good $3,000 below the national county average. The poverty rate, 14 percent, is 3 percent above the national average.

Under Anderson's employment contract, the district is obligated to review his salary annually. To that end, Anderson was directed by the board to prepare for soliciting proposals for a compensation consultant, which will be selected by the board, to determine fair market value of the CEO's position. The board's previous compensation consultant no longer works for the board. Such consultants report directly to the board and not to Anderson.

The commission voted 5-0 to recommend denial of an application to divide a collection of mining claims into three lots, creating a new, 1.6-acre site for a single-family home perched above Hopkins Avenue on a bench of land on lower Shadow Mountain.

Another fundamental flaw in the Cascade study is its attempt to suggest that our pseudoephedrine law did nothing to reduce meth use. Our law was not designed to address meth use; it was about domestic meth manufacturing. Most meth comes from Mexico, which has banned pseudoephedrine entirely and forced the drug cartels to switch to methods of manufacture without pseudoephedrine, a more difficult process that results in weaker meth.

Cleveland's second-largest bank also said that, as of Monday, it's under new restrictions from the Office of Thrift Supervision. Third Federal came under fire from OTS last summer for having too many potentially risky loans - mainly because of its 30 percent concentration in second mortgages, meaning home equity lines or loans. These are more risky because in case of a foreclosure, in a foreclosure, they get paid second, which means they may not get repaid at all.

We have a few health care professionals in the volunteer orchestra and, luckily, some of them were nearby in the hall when it happened, as well as some other orchestra members. Then a total stranger, an audience member waiting in line to buy his concert ticket, rushed over when he saw a person on the ground. Turns out, Fred Butsch is a retired nurse and just did what came naturally — a human being coming to the aid of someone in need. And then Fred refused free entry into the concert as a thank-you, saying instead he wanted to support HSO.

Facing an unprecedented $8 billion hole in the state budget, Kasich's two-year spending blueprint also dished out plenty of cuts, including dicing to the local governments, K-12 education, library funding and the state's politically powerful nursing home industry.

-- If you don't have a smartphone: iPhones are still the kings of the smartphone world, with unsurpassed access to high-quality applications. But they're also expensive. That may not be immediately obvious in the cellphone store, where their $199 price tag (or, in the case of the iPhone 3GS, $0 price tag) looks comparable to many other phones. Carriers require contracts when selling iPhones at that price, and the available plans aren't cheap, in part because you'll need a data plan. In effect, you'll be paying off that expensive phone over two years, through your monthly bill.

That's not just wishful thinking. Social Security is the oil tanker of government programs and doesn't turn on a dime. Corrections made early will be far less disruptive. Consider, for instance, the variety of factors that shortened the program's route to insolvency this past year: a higher cost-of-living adjustment as a result of rising energy prices and lower-than-expected worker earnings. The effects of such seemingly modest adjustments are huge because they resonate for years to come.
"This is how it is," he said. "Your dirt farmer from Iowa, or wherever it is, gets here with a little pile, just about enough to keep him, and at first, after freezing his face in those blizzards for forty years, it's great. He has a swell time, sees the Mt. Wilson Observatory, the Pacific Ocean, the millionaires' houses in Pasadena, the Huntington Museum, and Hollywood; he's never seen anything like that before, and he loves it. But then what? There ain't no more. After six months he's so sick of doing nothing that he'll take fifteen dollars a week, or ten dollars a week, or three dollars a week; or he'll start any kind of cock-eyed business, he'll do anything, just to keep busy. And boy, maybe you think that baby can't hate union labor! Because union labor, anyhow the way he figures it, means that pretty soon he's out of a job, and there's nothing for him to do but water the grass."

Though the cocktail was made famous by the Bay Area's very own Trader Vic's, tiki expert Otto von Stroheim of Tiki News magazine (tikinews.com) says it was inspired by a Hawaiian drink made with rum and okolehao, a form of moonshine from the ti plant. In the 1946 edition of "Trader Vic's Book of Food and Drink," the scorpion bowl called for nearly 50 ounces of liquid orgeat (almond-flavored) syrup and mint. The recipe changed in subsequent editions of Trader Vic's books, and today, various venues serve scorpion bowls with a combination of light and dark rums and brandy, with different nut liqueurs -- if any nut flavor at all -- in place of orgeat. Bartenders may add other combinations of fruit juices or even top it off with sparkling wine. Still, von Stroheim says the drink recipe is fairly standard among tiki bars.

The third-warmest winter since 1945 hasn't had as big an effect on steelhead fishing as many anglers had hoped.

A: In February of '09, I had a medical condition that had put me on bed rest. I was watching a TV show about an obesity clinic, and I was watching people 400 or 500 pounds having to be cut out of their houses. I had stepped on the scale about two weeks earlier, and I was 646 pounds. Two weeks later here I am, laid up, and I'm 150 pounds, 200 pounds bigger than some of these folks on the TV special. I just said, enough. I said a prayer. I changed my diet, and weight started falling off. I lost about 100 pounds, then another 30 or 40.

"This is the only lyric I've written that consists of one long incomplete sentence," Sondheim says. "I wanted it to be like the descriptive caption you might read in a museum next to the painting.

“For many of these kids, it’s three or four years before they get better. In that time, I’ve seen so many families go through divorce or the siblings wind up in a bad place.

I have no doubt that elected officials go to Washington with great intentions. Yet the effects of fundraising and partisanship have long been clear in our nation's headlines. Rather than politicians who promise support to political parties or to the special interests that help raise campaign cash, we need politicians who focus, as members of the military do, on their allegiance to the U.S. Constitution and the people of this nation.

Don't lift too fast. Whether on a machine or with dumbbells, your movements should be slow and controlled, Williford says.

Lifting slowly also gives you time to concentrate on correct form and technique.

Conditioning tax exemption for churches on refraining from speaking about certain things is just as dangerous as taxing churches outright. Those conditions break down the healthy "wall of separation between state and church" articulated by Thomas Jefferson in his letter to the Danbury Baptists.

Oregon's governor, John Kitzhaber, stopped the impending execution of two-time convicted killer Gary Haugen, granting a "temporary reprieve ... for the duration of my term in office." Haugen's death sentence had been the subject of extensive review and the prisoner himself had argued that he should die. The governor should either have allowed execution to proceed or commuted the sentence. He did neither, treating the prisoner, the victims' families, and the dozens of court and prison officials in this case with cruel irresponsibility.
The loss exposes the latest breakdown of risk controls at a big international financial institution, along with U.S. banks that have hemorrhaged billions of dollars since the crisis in subprime mortgages developed last summer.

As a new parent, everything about your new baby is measured in milestones.

Which brings my wife and me to our latest milestone with our 7-month-old son wee Mac: his first tooth.
One of those opportunities was with Chris Getz at the plate. Yost put a safety squeeze on and Getz bunted the ball foul down the first base line. A safety squeeze requires a better bunt than a suicide. The runner waits to see that the bunt is good enough before breaking for home. On a suicide if the ball gets down anywhere the runner will probably be safe. The situation was first and third with one down and Ned may have been trying to avoid yet another double play  although Getz is pretty hard to double up.
That hardly proved to be the case, though, leaving Hill to say afterward that he feels "blessed" he can still play basketball. At least for now.

Wednesday started with a tip that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency was planning “something big” on an unspecified Chicago issue. Tribune editors wanted to know more information as they assessed the stories that staff reporters would be tackling for Thursday’s newspaper, but for most of the day we could only speculate. A good deal of interest was for investigative stories the Tribune has pushed:

At Mount Tamalpais State Park, the vibe is very different. The park is reached by driving up, down and around winding, hilly roads, and on a sunny Saturday morning in spring we dodged, by my count, 29 fast-moving mountain bikers. Mountain biking originated here in Marin County; the cyclists I observed tended to blow through stop signs, just as they do in St. Louis.

Contrary to partisan rhetoric, the economic challenges aren't simple or clear-cut. Wages of middle-class families essentially have been stagnant for years. Global competition has brought fundamental shifts to the American job market. The old high-wage manufacturing jobs aren't coming back. Limited population growth in metro Phoenix and about 60,000 empty houses make it clear the days of rapid-fire construction are in the past or the distant future. Stratospheric home prices and generous home-equity loans no longer exist to mask the shortfall in wages.

The Bachelor Recap: After the Final Rose
A growing body of promising research had given the researchers some suspicions about what they'd see. In depression and several other psychiatric disorders, studies have begun to detect a pattern of "hyperconnectivity" between three widely scattered "networks" in the brain: the network of structures in which we process emotion and response to threats ("the affective network"); the network of structures that allows us to focus our attention, to reason and make higher-order judgments ("the cognitive control network"); and a cluster of regions that comes alive as a group when our minds are at rest — brain structures that help us ponder the intentions and mental states of others, consider our personal experiences and assess our emotions (dubbed the "default mode network").

"Slumdog Millionaire" will open commercially later this fall, so I'll confine myself to only a few effusions now, with more to come. There's never been anything like this densely detailed phantasmagoria -- groundbreaking in substance, damned near earth-shaking in style. Mr. Boyle and his colleagues, including his Indian co-director, Loveleen Tandan, have pulled off a soaring, crowd-pleasing fantasy that's a tale of unswerving love, a searing depiction of poverty and injustice and a marvelous evocation of multinational media madness. When I spoke to the director after the first screening here -- actually the first public screening anywhere -- I said his film was a great example of what the late Carol Reed once advised: Find the right container, and you can fill it with whatever you wish. "Yes," Danny Boyle replied, "and I also try to follow David Lean's advice to declare your ambitions in the first five minutes." The ambitions declared at the beginning of "Slumdog Millionaire" are huge. By the end they're completely fulfilled.

Cape Town, South Africa: What can be sexier than hip design, pan-global food, award-stealing wine, white-sand beaches and a pre-cocktail jolt of adrenaline from a great white shark dive? Cape Town seethes with sexiness, from its funky, art-gallery-and-cafe-lined streets in gentrified inner-city hoods such as De Waterkant and Woodstock to Camps Beach, where the gorgeous gather. Start the day in your sleek bed at POD, a boutique hotel that makes you want to don a backless dress and slink through the minimalist lobby. Head to a late breakfast overlooking the water at the Grand (Camps Bay). Later, stroll hand-in-hand through the market in the Old Biscuit Mill, where you can feed each other artisanal cheeses, sample beer and shop for the sparkling wine and snacks you'll take on your gentle hike up Lions Head Mountain. For dinner, don the backless dress and make sure you're booked (six weeks in advance) at the Test Kitchen, the hottest restaurant in Cape Town. Afterward, indulge in a Nutty Slutty cocktail at the rooftop bar TjingTjing. Next morning? The shark dive, of course.

Checking in: Considering this stretch of "downtown" is only a few blocks long, lodging is scant. The Geyserville Inn, a 41-room hotel at the north end of town, is not fancy but it is efficient. My standard room had a modest-size bathroom, queen-size bed, television and a mini refrigerator (which hummed sporadically all night). Oddly, the room also had a gas fireplace. Though my reservation didn't include breakfast at the Hoffman House restaurant next door, the desk clerk threw it in upon request. It never hurts to ask.

Even as a 34-year veteran, Beate is still passionate about his country and its embarrassment of natural riches and is generous with his knowledge of Ecuadorean flora and fauna. During my two days with him, I was treated to a nonstop flow of fascinating digressions, including how to identify certain birds by their calls, including hummingbirds (a strange clicking sound); quetzals (a descending trill); umbrella birds (a moo-ing sound, which is why Ecuadoreans call them bull birds) and toucans (a call in which they seem to be telling us, "Dios te de" or, in English, "God will provide.")

Even today, it's easy to see why: Besides the courtyard, veranda and chapel, all of which remain, you get a broad view of the cradling hills, and if you can find your way to the enormous California black walnut tree that was planted in 1870 or so, you can marvel at the gnarled branches reaching skyward like tentacles from the Earth.

Young d'Artagnan (dreary Logan Lerman) travels to Paris to join the king's musketeers, only to find dashing Athos (Matthew MacFadyen), brawny Porthos (Ray Stevenson) and devout Aramis (Luke Evans) in grumpy retirement. Conniving Cardinal Richelieu (Christoph Waltz) dominates callow King Louis XIII (Freddie Fox), and the rogue's private guard has supplanted the loyal musketeers. Richelieu's troops are led by eye-patched Rochefort (Mads Mikkelsen), who takes an immediate dislike to d'Artagnan.

My Take: Sorry, but I'm a little distracted. I was just home for the start of Passover and Carly appears to be wearing the upholstery from my parents' couch. OK. Distraction over. Thank you, Carly, for being tonight's first contestant to sing a version of the song that approximated the difficulty and range of the original. Note that I said "approximated" and not "equaled," because that would just be silly. I'm not sure if Carly exactly has the lyrics down, but this is the best workout she's given her pipes in many a week and she's the first singer since Syesha to have any fun with this theme at all. Yeah, she's shouty, but I've always thought that "Jesus Christ Superstar" was a bit of a shouty song.

Is the 4-inch maple apple bacon pie ($5.25) sweet or savory or both? I'm not sure, but it was interesting enough to include. The maple can't compete with the bacon and just gets lost, but that's OK. Snuggling against the perfectly diced bacon is a generous handful of thinly sliced apples, cooked just long enough to release the apple sweetness but not so long that the apples lose their integrity. The combination of sweet apples and salty bacon shouldn't work, but it does -- and you'll have the empty plate to prove it.

Tough to mimic that type of camaraderie. Onto the links:

Here's where things could get a little confusing: Kim wrote "Tree City" as Kim but the songs as Denizen Kane - which is also the name of one of the three main characters, played with visceral intensity by Sean San José. Kim, who performs the songs with mesmerizing folk-hip-hop magnetism, plays Denizen's idolized older brother Junie. He's dead, which is probably why Kim/Junie performs behind a scrim, with the deft, jazzy Dirty Boots musicians Rachel Lastimosa and James Dumlao.

Stafford, Ndamukong Suh and Nate Burleson reworked their deals to get the Lions to the mandatory salary cap. And now Johnson's deal gives president Tom Lewand and general manager Martin Mayhew a far more manageable 2012 salary-cap number than the $21.2 million number had he played out the final year of his rookie contract. There's now more room to re-sign left tackle Jeff Backus (a must ...deal with it, haters) and perhaps middle linebacker Stephen Tulloch, who's possibly seeking a deal three times as large as the $3.2-million "bargain" he gave the Lions last summer.

I want to understand why that is and what can be done about it, if anything. That would obviously impact the game presentation. I want it to be the best it can be. Twenty-first century fans kind of expect that. And if they expect it, I want to deliver it.”

A: Land Rover was not ranked among brands in J.D. Power and Associates' 2012 Vehicle Dependability Study because J.D. Power said it received too small of a sample size, but in the 2011 study, Land Rover ranked 32nd out of 34 brands. The 2011 study measured problems experienced by owners of 2008 models during the third year of ownership. Land Rover placed last among all brands in the 2010 J.D. Power study and 35th out of 37 brands in 2009. Clearly there's a pattern here, and it would require a remarkable turnaround for the company to place among the top brands in the next survey.

But the petitioners' complaints about the contents of the flier CASA representatives are handing out — Delegate Smigiel called it "half truths and lies" and wondered, "How is that not voter suppression?" — are thin. The fliers are strongly opinionated and include a less than charitable description of the motives of those backing the petition drive, and they certainly don't acknowledge any of the counter-arguments. But they don't include information that is untrue.
First thought is the way Kyle Flood handles the media is quite refreshing. No filler, all information. You ask a question and he gives you an answer. You ask, "What do you think of the quarterbacks?" He says, "No one has pulled ahead yet, but both are starting to play at a high level." Flood already wins the award for most no nonsense Q & A. It's refreshing and I think gives fans the ability to buy in that much easier.

Hearts of romaine ($14) is DePersio's version of the classic Caesar salad; here it's updated with aged prosciutto -- what a great idea -- and grated ricotta salata. Fall harvest soup ($14) is mushroom-based, but this is not a heavy, earthy soup. This boasts at least a dozen fresh vegetables in a light broth; swimming atop are three pieces of crostini smothered in homemade pesto. DePersio will tell you his vegetables are fresh, but the beans and peas in this soup are so alive with flavor you wonder if there isn't a garden in the kitchen itself. (Proving his love of vegetables, DePersio offers a vegetarian tasting menu.)

The questions the trials prompted are the usual ones that pop up before every major championship: Are the horses jumping too much and too hard? What about the time frame, more than four months out from the Games? Who should be excused from the trials? Is objective better than subjective, and vice versa? Are the trials needed at all to produce a medal-winning team?

Harrington, 32, is only 8-for-27 from the floor in the series and averaging 10.5 points — well under his regular-season average of 14.2.

But defense was where he wanted to be, so he signed with the Ducks and spent the

Stevenson started most of the season, including the majority of the Mavericks’ 18-1 spurt from late January to early March, then gave way when second-year guard Rodrigue Beaubois returned from a broken left foot.

Equal-weighted ETFs have their drawbacks. For one, they skew an S&P 500 fund more toward midcap stocks because they take an equal allocation in every stock in the index. That will cause the ETF to lag behind if large stocks take off. With a 0.4% expense ratio, the Guggenheim ETF is also pricier than typical market-cap-weighted ETFs. But those factors are more than offset by eliminating the risks of concentrating in one stock, Ms. Berenyi says.
And make no mistake, Palin will be using the "Today" platform to deliver a political message, albeit with a lighter touch perhaps than she would on Fox News. Calling in to "Today" on Monday to discuss her appearance, Palin said she hoped "we won't bore viewers with too much in-depth political talk."

His whole demeanor is understated, as though he wished he could remain quietly anonymous. It is something of a wonder that Florence is now part of the Portobello Dock landscape; for years Dixon refused to say a thing about his home life. It goes without saying that he doesn't much enjoy the spotlight of an interview, but he is generous with his time when you do pin him down.

Smith: Funding, including doing everything we can to maintain and amplify the city's commitment to funding. Supporting the proposed arts levy from the Creative Advocacy Network initiative or a version of it. If the promoters find that the existing issue is going to be hard to pass or if there are too many other things on the ballot, that we have a Plan B.

Support existing programs but also particularly to amplify them around our plan for Portland summers so that our city has the most robust set of summer enrichment programs of any major city in the country. That can do a lot to increase graduation rates, improve educational competitiveness and be a great way for the education community and the arts community to better interface. We can encourage more and help zone for more and fund more live-work spaces. Milepost 5 is an example of an experiment that seems to be working.

Those differences surely exist. Obama and his Republican challenger are offering voters a distinct choice on taxes, a sharp disagreement over health care and a classic ideological divide on social issues that neither candidate seems eager to talk about.

In the previous survey in July, the economists predicted unemployment of 8.7 percent at the end of next year. In the survey before that, they foresaw 8.4 percent. Some now think unemployment won't drop to a historically normal 5.5 percent to 6 percent until at least 2018 -- several years later than envisioned earlier.

Kicillof, 41, is the political side of the equation. While he's just a deputy economy minister and officially her second-ranking representative in the YPF intervention, the expropriation was essentially his project from the start. He helped draft the law, which ignores a constitutional requirement to pay in advance for expropriations, and strongly argued that Spain's Repsol shouldn't get anywhere near the $10.5 billion it has demanded in compensation.

Assembly hereby finds and declares that the state is confronted with an unprecedented fiscal crisis.''
Supply is not the cause of high gas prices; refining capacity is the driver. The Canadian oil sands and the Bakken oil shale deposits in the Dakotas are nothing new to the oil companies — it’s just that the cost and effort to get the oil is expensive, and it is easier to get oil from liquid reserves. It costs about $40-$50 per barrel to extract this oil, so the per-barrel price needs to stay high, as it is now, for oil companies to make a profit.

"They treated us right," Hunter said.
Not all rappers have been drawn to the poet. But those interested in extending the legacy of social engagement through music invariably turned to Gil Scott-Heron's records for inspiration, and often much more. De La Soul sampled "The Bottle," Chuck D of Public Enemy occasionally mimicked Heron's delivery, Dr. Dre and RBX quoted him at length on "Blunt Time." And Kanye West devoted the entire final track of "My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy" to a re-framing of Scott-Heron's "Comment No.1," first recorded on "Small Talk," all the way back in 1970. "Who will survive in America?," Scott-Heron asked, over and over. It's a question that remains as relevant today as it was when he first posed it.

Thursday afternoon, he walked among the rubble -- walls destroyed, foam insulation strewn about, wooden planks dangling in the kitchen.
I have to totally agree with Susan Reimer's assertion that Democrats must be living in a lovely dream waiting for the November elections ("Women will remember in November," March 12). True, some Republican presidential hopefuls have come down with foot in mouth disease, and there seems to be no shortage of eyebrow raising sound bites coming from the endless parade of televised debates. However, it's not the gaffes or the "I shouldn't have said that" moments that are making Democrats salivate for the coming elections but the realization that once again, the women's vote will lock onto a single issue and make it a major election point.
“He had a big role for us in Game 1 and he’s going to have a bigger role now that Caron is out,” Clippers Coach Vinny Del Negro said Tuesday.
Thwarting those efforts appears to be the primary motivation for challenger David D. Hack, 71. He is a Vietnam veteran and military clothing entrepreneur who promises to focus "on Hudson alone" and vehemently opposes tax-sharing. This approach assumes that Hudson -- or any other community -- can wall itself off and remain immune from problems facing its neighbors in the region. That is wishful thinking.
Is natural gas more abundant? Today, the total recoverable natural gas reserves in the United States are around 2,000 trillion cubic feet. Of that, about three-quarters of the total is from traditional gas reservoirs and approximately 500 trillion cubic feet are from shale reservoirs.

As Japan rebuilds from the March 11 disaster, public health officials worry that a lingering sense of hopelessness among those affected might lead to a surge in suicides in a nation already coping with one of the developed world's highest rates of self-inflicted deaths.

It will now go to a public hearing, before council votes on its final approval.

Sixty years later, a few days after the horrors of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, I asked him which day had a more profound immediate impact on America, assuming the proud veteran would give the nod to the seminal event of his youth.

"I had the singers choose the songs they were going to do because I wanted them to feel an attachment to something that was speaking to them in the song," Bass said recently over lunch in midtown Sacramento.
The Jones family has become leery of outsiders, who are angling with their own agendas. Former Jones coaches, parents, strangers, and media are all greeted this week with, "Can I call you back in five minutes?" while the family huddles and tries to figure out who can be trusted, and who cannot. Because fans, coaches, friends -- everyone, it seems -- wants something from Jones.

Bruell underscores his European leanings with inventive looks at less-common parts of the animal. He places crisp chicken livers on a fruited bitter greens salad ($9); rolls up an unctuous, tender lamb breast ($15 lunch, $19 dinner); and coaxes the meat off the bone of a pork shank ($18). Texture is center stage here, all the way to the cooking of fish, the hallmark of his work at Parallax.

"This is the third time in four years we haven't been able to finish the whole tournament," said East coach Dan Skaer. "This year was exactly the same as last year - we were able to squeeze in the doubles indoors and outdoors, but the singles got cancelled. Two years ago we actually had nice weather, but three years ago the singles was rained out also. We were rained out last weekend at the Moline Tournament, so we're hurting."

The money is enough to restore half of a teaching position in the Engineering and Auto Tech program at HilHi, meaning the school can add back two auto shop and four introductory engineering classes, Domes said this week. All donors, big or small, should be commended for stepping forward to save a program that enrolls about 180 students annually and teaches skills that, with additional training, can translate to living-wage jobs.

Q: How long is the sun up on June 22 in Sacramento?
Doubts though were bubbling about Franklin after his four turnovers in the second half of MU's 45-24 loss to Oklahoma State on Oct. 22. Coupled with a crucial game-opening interception against Kansas State two weeks before and two interceptions in the 52-17 romp over Iowa State in between, the turnovers were obscuring the fact Franklin was on course for the third-best season of total offense in Mizzou history, if the Tigers reach a bowl.

FSU's home slate this fall includes the following: Murray State, Savannah State, Wake Forest, Clemson, Duke, Boston College and Florida.

Authorities say a high school football player has died after collapsing during a game in Westminster.
Saturday, when Miller and the Nuggets return to the Rose Garden, I'm guessing Miller will get another ovation. Only this time, I bet it will be a little louder. A bit more meaningful. And even more heartfelt than it was during that Dec. 29 game.
Unlike Wednesday night when the Cougars blasted Greenville 54-21 in a semifinal game in which they never trailed, the Explorers jumped out to a 3-0 advantage after Central missed its first four shots. But Starrett, a 6-foot-4 center, picked up two quick fouls and went to the bench with 5 minutes 22 seconds to go in the opening quarter with Alton Marquette in front.
But she didn’t stop there. Robinson-Briggs repeated her comments, first made in a public meeting, to the local newspaper and, upping the ante, added that some local veterans were "offended by that kind of behavior." The mayor says Williams doesn’t participate in prayer either.
The traditional route to showbiz success involves moving to one of the entertainment hubs, Los Angeles or New York. Smith gave both a try. "I moved to L.A. in 2000 and lived there for two years. And I moved to New York in 2005 and lived there for two years."
Kevin McHale's Rockets aren't into moral victories, though, so they don't want applause for a near victory. But they deserve it after a 101-99 overtime loss.
What purpose will the church's action serve? If carried out to its logical conclusion, it means employees will have to buy health insurance on their own.

Added Wade: “It’s very unfortunate, one of the great players in our game. You never want to see anyone go through an injury. Obviously, we’re sure he will bounce back. One thing about this league, we have some of the best doctors and trainers. It’s very unfortunate for him and his family. I’m sure Orlando will miss him and the Olympic team is going to miss him. But the biggest thing is that he gets healthy and he’ll get back to be an amazing player he is for this game.”

Voter fraud has been part of East St. Louis' history since its earliest days. Indeed, the 1861 election that gave the city its name was bought and paid for.

Her brother wasn't trying to play games, or increase the drama, or even milk the moment on Friday. He was simply seeking relief from an absurd process that few of us can relate with. Instead, he's found himself squeezed even tighter. One Jones family member told me on Wednesday that irrational and well-meaning fans at the finalist colleges, who believe they're serving as de facto recruiters, serve as the worst enemy of their respective programs.
"Barack Obama needs to do well in Northeast Ohio in 2012, and having a story like this, taking a popular local leader into a national role will certainly help that," Sracic said.

In the fall, she read about Tuohy's vaccine in a Clinic newsletter, around the time she was undergoing radiation treatments. A few weeks later, in November, she met with him.
Mr. Santorum likes to argue that "Governor Romney doesn't provide the contrast we need to beat Barack Obama" on issues like health care and cap and trade, and he's on to something. But he's yet to take his own point and focus on the sweeping economic contrast voters are aching to hear. To the extent Mr. Santorum makes that argument, it often comes second to his cultural pitch.

Olsen's performance in the film, in which she plays the title character (long story), is haunting, but that description doesn't really get at how powerful it is.

What you will witness over the next 6 months is the rest of the story. Domonic Brown is at a pivotal point in his career with the Phillies. In some respects, you can't help but feel sorry for the kid. Charlie Manuel won't want to hear that. He's a baseball man, and baseball is all about paying your dues. You want to play in The Show, you better respect the game, respect the process. Sometimes, it can feel like The Process is trying to break you. And maybe it is. But it is still The Process, and virtually every player who has ever played beneath a third deck has endured it. You look around the Phillies clubhouse and see players like Ryan Howard, who was midway through his 25-year-old season before he finally got a full-time shot. You see Chase Utley, who played in 113 games at Triple A as a 24-year-old. And, of course, you see guys like Manuel, who was 31 years old when he finally gave up on major league baseball and headed over the Pacific to play in Japan.

FLETCHER, N.C. -- Rolling through small Southern towns in a campaign-style bus, President Barack Obama on Monday pressed lawmakers back in Washington to start taking up pieces of his rejected jobs bill and mocked the Republicans who had shot it down in total.

Also floating amid a sea of stereotypes is a memory-addled mother (Sissy Spacek), one who gets smarter but never increasingly ill (as normally might occur) as she needs to gain some revenge on her rich, racist, restroom-obsessed ringleader of a daughter (Bryce Dallas Howard). A very predictable pie piece, instigated by world-class cook Minny and used by said “ailing” Mom to get even, also wears a bit thin — and we’re not talking about an especially soft crust, either.

Los Angeles County residents look into their magic mirrors and see a humane and enlightened region with pragmatic criminal justice laws, unlike those backward, supposedly execution-crazy folks in places like Texas. The facts state otherwise. While the rest of California condemns felons to death at the same slowing pace as the rest of the nation, prosecutors in Los Angeles seek the death penalty aggressively. This single county sent more people to death row in 2009 than the entire state of Texas.

At Coachella, the ShowScoop team distributed pairs of branded blue-and-white sunglasses and packs of sunscreen to eager music fans.
Romney is almost constantly cracking jokes with the people around him – whether they are governors or college students or his staff. He likes practical jokes and fast food, whether cameras are rolling or not.

That's especially damaging to Romney, who should have been able to count on at least a decent shot at taking the state in November, given his deep roots there. Obama still has many things to worry about in the general-election campaign, but winning Michigan is not one of them.

In both cases, the tests can lead to unneeded invasive procedures, overtreatment, unnecessary radiation exposure and misdiagnosis.
The roasted chicken entree exemplifies Seeber's restrained approach. There are no gimmicks here, just handsomely presented and patiently prepared pieces of flavorful chicken, served with sauteed kale and a pretty white bean and tomato casserole. An entree of stout-glazed 24-hour short ribs, served with roasted turnips and pickled red onions, is similarly effective and flavor-focused.

In the early 1960s, he divided the land into residential lots, and in 1962 he broke ground for the country club.
Federal regulators deferred to states on several other important questions, including marketing rules and what kind of health-provider networks insurance plans must include.

Hancock County Sheriff Mike Shepherd has said Vangundy did not need to be at the scene because a deputy coroner was available. Shepherd initially believed that the deputy prosecutor arrived at the scene before Vangundy but said today Vangundy might have been there first.

But frozen yogurt wasn't invented yesterday -- or even in the past few years. TCBY, The Country's Best Yogurt, has been around since 1981, and there are six locations in the Portland area.

Personal Safety: The No.1 concern for anyone clearing land is personal safety. From small nicks and cuts to gaping wounds and sprains, clearing land is not only physical, but can involve the use of dangerous equipment. Always wear eye and ear protection when using weed eaters, chainsaws and chippers. Ankle-high boots, thick pants, long-sleeved shirts and gloves should be worn like a uniform. And taking regular, hydrating breaks will keep the likelihood of injury low.

Republicans are currently neither fat nor happy. But many conservatives feel betrayed by an administration and Congress that they believe veered from basic GOP principles on any number of economic, foreign policy and social matters. Their lack of enthusiasm was intensified by the nomination of a candidate with whom the party base has always had a tenuous relationship. So McCain was forced rightward in his selection of a running mate to motivate conservative stalwarts, costing him an opportunity to reach out to the political center.
Bloomberg also cited two executive orders signed by acting Gov. Richard Codey in 2005 as an agreement that the NYPD had with state officials to operate within New Jersey.

Moore stymied the powerful Texas lineup by working seven scoreless inning in the opener at Arlington. The Rays brought him on again in hopes of holding the Rangers to a 3-2 lead, and it looked like the move might work.

At times, hiking through the park seemed like a lunar experience. The Notch Trail cuts through a canyon surrounded by colorless towering rocks leading to an open area seemingly devoid of life. To reach the trail's namesake "notch" above a cliff overlooking the White River Valley, hikers have a rare and slightly daunting opportunity to scale a steep log ladder leading to a ledge where the trail continues. While exploring the area, I quickly noticed that little pieces of rock could be chipped away easily with a fingernail. That serves as a warning that you can't fully trust your surroundings, especially when teetering on a cliff.

When Cobb and Ariadne make the tremulous and altogether familiar-sounding decision ("No!" "But I've got to!" "But it's too dangerous!" "But it's our only hope!" "OK, but I'm coming with you!") to move down into a fourth dream world, I hoped we might finally be headed for a riot of architectural invention. Instead, we get an odd, desultory cross between downtown Los Angeles circa 1965 and the urban-planning fantasies of the French Modernist architect Le Corbusier. Downtown's 1965 Department of Water and Power building, designed by AC Martin and Partners, has been stretched in Seussian fashion to become a very tall skyscraper; on the horizon, meanwhile, appear dozens if not hundreds of Corbusian, tenement-like towers.
Stoudemire apologized for his actions on Twitter, but that didn't stop the notoriously tough New York media from taking aim at his incredibly selfish act. The New York Post went with the headline "Bloody Idiot" and more than one scribe has thrown around the expletive "Glass#*%@" to describe Stat.

Sure, the Cats defense ranks among the Arena Football League's top 10, having risen from second-to-last after surrendering 70 points and 386 yards in the team's season opener. However, as Hill prepared this week for Saturday's home game against the Kansas City Command (0-4), the four fourth-quarter touchdowns the SaberCats (3-2) gave up in last week's 61-55 loss to Philadelphia weighed heavily on the defensive back's mind.

After Anzio, their obsolete fleet was upgraded to P-51 Mustangs. They painted the tails red -- thus the nickname -- and were given riskier missions, escorting bombers to France, Germany, Austria and Hungary. Many reports have claimed they never lost a bomber. They did, but only a few.
At a Shaker Heights open house, neighbors and former residents wandered through a 1950s colonial on Colby Road. The house, which failed to sell at $340,000 in 2008, just hit the market again at $279,000, a price drop of nearly 18 percent. One visitor asked the real estate agent whether the owner would be willing to rent it out, rather than sell.

YOU Docs are on record saying that for folks 50 and up, the vaccine called Pneumovax reduces inflammation that damages blood vessels and makes your brain foggy and your thinking fuzzy. Dr. Oz got this high-caliber shot when he tuned 50; so did Young Dr. Mike! Does Prevnar do the same?

Medicare and most insurance companies cover it. If yours doesn't, SWITCH; they are demonstrating just how much they do not care about you. * * *

Scott said the young forward told him this was the first time he learned how to play basketball in a lot of different areas, "which I thought was interesting.

Still, Wilson does engage in speculative biography, reading between the lines of the "Commedia," the "La Vita Nuova" and the other works, striving to give us a portrait of a man who, long before he was a literary immortal, was like the rest of us: beleaguered by his job, by the turmoil of his times, struggling with debts, critics, jealousy.

"There was a feeling that since all the windsurfers were so new, and most of us were pretty young and we're girls, they could push us around," she said. "One of the main reasons I went through what I went through was I wanted to show them that they can't walk on us, that windsurfing is a force, that the windsurfers do care. It's not a joke for us, no matter what level we are."

While he doesn't agree with the delivery, he understands the intent. The demographic for those companies' customers "is ages 12-24. They like much, much heavier stimulation — strong fragrance and loud music. It's very dramatic," he said. "But it turns off a huge customer base."
But the findings also could give ammunition to critics who say too many students are attending four-year schools — and that pushing them to finish wastes even more taxpayer money.

In August, as a prelude to presenting the budget, he told the County Council that revenue was $10 million behind last year's pace. To give police officers and other employees a much-needed raise, he said, there would need to be a tax increase. Otherwise, Mr. Dooley said, he would have no choice but to fire cops.

On the other hand, Jorge Ollero Per�n, a young Spanish government worker, told me how upsetting it was for him to see news reports on TV of illegal immigrants from Africa who had drowned in the Strait of Gibraltar trying to reach Spain.

As an afterthought, she said, she added that she might run for mayor on a platform of disincorporating the city. The response was overwhelming, she said, so she quietly put together a slate of candidates and went door-to-door before the April municipal elections.

Despite his sunny remarks, Huntsman’s path to the GOP nomination, already unlikely, grew dimmer with his finish on Tuesday. The next state to hold a voting contest, South Carolina, features socially conservative, religious voters who are not Huntsman’s base. And then there’s Florida, which has multiple expensive media markets and typically features an airwaves war that the candidate is unlikely to be able to afford. Huntsman’s fundraising has been weak, though a pro-Huntsman super PAC largely funded by Huntsman’s billionaire father has helped his candidacy.

My friend, "Stephanie," and this guy had been broken up for quite some time. Not thinking, I later blurted out the story to her, sort of a "can you believe what an idiot I am" funny tale. She took offense, and I felt awful for hurting her as well as for opening my mouth with an insensitive story. I did apologize. But as we discussed the incident over text and email (a terrible way to communicate in these types of situations), it turned out that my moment of flirtation was much more to Stephanie than a drunken comment. Apparently she didn't trust me, didn't think any of my girlfriends should trust me and took issue with the way I had handled other situations. After some angry exchanges on both sides, our friendship was over for good.

James began writing the books as fan fiction to Stephenie Meyer's "Twilight" series and quickly developed a cult-like following of her own. The romance between Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey is surprising because of its unconventional nature: Grey asks Steele to sign a contract, and she agrees to be his "submissive" and to partake in a range of erotic activities. The stories were first published online, and as word of mouth spread, droves of people  many of them not traditional readers of romantic or erotic fiction  began downloading them on iPads and Kindles.

The cappuccino is well-made and strong, or eschew the caffeine and ease into the morning with a lavender-scented mimosa. I, however, head straight for the bagel and smoked salmon. Chef Giselle Wellman cuts the bagel thin before toasting and buttering it, then slathering it with cream cheese and loading on thinly sliced smoked salmon.

Good advice: If your bookcase will be sitting on a hardwood floor, you can buy felt floor protectors with adhesive on one side that prevent the bottom of the case from scratching the floor when it is moved. If you stand a tall bookcase on carpeting, you might have to shim the base to prevent it from tumbling forward, since carpet and underlayment are softer than flooring.

Winning back-to-back series in New York and Boston is actually a pretty big deal for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that this is still a fairly young team that is building confidence with each happy circumstance. The Yankees and Red Sox are not what they were in the early 2000s, but they will always be the teams that the Orioles measure themselves against...and the O's have measured up very well against them this year. Even during the disappointing three-game sweep the Yankees pulled off at Camden Yards last month, it was obvious that the Orioles were much more competitive.
Some of his fellow pitching mates such as Kyle Lohse said they didn't find Carpenter to be quite as, well, animated, when he wasn't satisfied with a pitch, and Carpenter appeared to swallow one epithet, which came out as more of a gargle than a scream.

Her website displays confident real-woman models with flesh protruding in places that are generally verboten in fashion shoots. Suits priced from $175 to $350 are sized for bra sizes from A to DD and sometimes larger, a rarity in the swimsuit business. Bottoms have equal variety. Ms. Mills eschews a house "fit model"—someone who represents the ideal client for that brand. Instead, she uses the women who work with her, experimenting until the design either works or is discarded.

“The fans’ connection with a team becomes a part of their identity,” said Coakley, the author of the text book “Sports in Society.” “Fans everywhere reaffirm those identities for each other so that they feel special — and they often make a special point of doing this when teams are unsuccessful and they need extra reaffirmation to justify their support in the face of regular losses. Over time this pattern of identity reaffirmation becomes regularized and the fan identity serves as an important basis for their sense of self as well as their social lives and everyday conversations with fans and nonfans alike.

Cunningham said he began thinking about making the move after Alexander's fight with Andriy Kotelnik in August 2010, when he could see the strain that losing the weight was putting on his fighter and the way it sapped his energy. But at that point, Alexander was the WBC and IBF junior welterweight champ and his big fight with Timothy Bradley was in the negotiation stage, so it was no time to move up. After he lost the Bradley fight, HBO wanted him to fight Lucas Matthysse at 140 pounds. "HBO is paying the big bucks and they got the fight they wanted," Cunningham said.

World Series champions stumbled through September and landed in the AL wild-card spot.
Sarah Palin, who now says she is "seriously considering" a White House run, was one of the few Republicans who came to Gingrich's defense -- though a rather odd defense it was. She said he had been attacked by the "lamestream leftist media," a predictable, but rather inaccurate choice of words since it was the likes of Rush Limbaugh and Charles Krauthammer who delivered most of the body blows to Gingrich. But Palin also criticized the former speaker for not standing by his original critique of Ryan. "We should ignore . . . criticism of what it is that we say in an interview if we believe what it is that we say. Don't let them, in a 24-hour news cycle, make us change our positions," she told Fox's Sean Hannity. Gingrich's contention, of course, is that he didn't really believe what he said and that he really supports Ryan's approach.

Susan serves two kinds of shrimp: a very garlicky scampi and a slightly less garlicky Brazilian style with coconut milk, both served over rice, for $10.
As it plans future stations, Metro should begin pairing transit specialists like Parsons with architects who can bring a new level of sophistication to the task. That would be a first step in banishing for good the idea that impressive station architecture is a luxury that Metro — and by extension L.A. — can't afford. If Metro had used a single highly ambitious design template for the Red and Gold lines, after all, it would have saved money and improved the level of architecture.

"Wouldn’t those charges have been an embarrassment?" Bianchi asked. "Wouldn’t they have shocked the parishioners at St. Patrick Church?"
Much of what should be done is not new. Rather, it is a question of refining and adapting strategies, tactics, and methods that have already been developed and proven effective, then applying them more widely and intensively. The most non-traditional is perhaps to focus on root problems. These include developing the will and capacity to conserve and management natural resources. We should help people, from high-level decision makers to those who live close to nature and depend on it to exercise enlightened self interest. This is about awareness-raising and motivation — "hearts and minds" as the phrase goes. The traditional conservation approach of studying, monitoring and documenting the trends and decline of wildlife and habitats is insufficient. We have to work in teams to solve problems, not just document them and bring the bad news to the public. Sure, it's important to know what's going on and to bring this information to the world, but without action that deals with the immediate needs and underlying causality, it is merely hand-wringing and is really quite depressing. In most places we know enough to act, but the comfort zone of many conservationists is more studies and analysis. Science is important and the basis of our professional knowledge. Also important is our ability to work with people —I would say the most important. Getting the balance right between studying and acting is way off kilter, in my opinion. It's relatively easy to monitor what's going on and very difficult to do something effective and long-lasting about it. That's a key point we need to get right.
Cheese. "If it's runny and gooey, we won't let it in," says Janice Mosher, manager of the customer service center for the CBP. But interpretations vary on which cheeses are enterable, and inconsistency abounds. For years, American cheese lovers have exchanged tales of smuggling in young raw-milk cheeses, such as raw-milk Camembert, which is illegal to sell in this country because it has been aged less than 60 days. The raw-milk cheese regulations are the FDA's bailiwick but, at least for the time being, the FDA doesn't care what you bring in for yourself.

CSU's top backups are junior guard Jesse Carr and sophomore guard Dwight Smith. Miles also plays Kaipo Sabas, a sharpshooting guard who leads CSU in 3-point percentage. So the Rams have plenty of firepower coming off the bench. Murray State will counter with junior forward Latreze Mushatt, who averages five rebounds per game. But the Racers get little scoring from their bench.

The book is powerfully illustrated, beginning with the assassination and ending with the death, in 1926, of Robert Todd Lincoln, the president's surviving son. To leaf through its pages is to walk through the life of the nation after that night at Ford's Theater in 1865, watching as a man became a legend. To remember Lincoln, the Kunhardts demonstrate, is to remember ourselves -- for better and occasionally for worse. (The lone speech by a black man at the dedication of the Lincoln Memorial, we learn from "Looking for Lincoln," went largely unreported.)
The OSU senior was named the Big Ten Player of the Year for the fourth time, becoming the only Big Ten basketball player, men's or women's, to grab four awards. She was voted the player of the year by conference media, with Michigan State's Kalisha Keane picked by the league coaches.

A top 20 player in his class, the 6-foot-4 guard is the city’s most highly recruited player, with scholarship offers from St. John’s, Rutgers, Syracuse, Arizona, Georgetown and Iowa State. When Whitehead was on the floor and healthy, Lincoln rarely lost, but he missed time, early and late, and his high ankle sprain right before the borough playoffs may have cost Lincoln a shot at the city title as he wasn’t 100 percent for the Railsplitters' PSAL Class AA semifinal loss to eventual city and Federation champion Boys & Girls.

A Flood Watch will remain in effect until Monday morning.

"The Pirates! Band of Misfits" is the latest production from England’s Aardman Animations that has failed to resonate in a major way with American audiences. Known for creating "Wallace and Gromit" and "Chicken Run," Aardman’s most recent production, last winter’s "Arthur Christmas, grossed only $46 million domestically, though it raked in $100 million abroad. "Pirates" should follow that same trajectory, as it has already collected $63.7 million from 49 foreign countries.

A. Wakatobi Dive Resort ( wakatobi.com) has a camp-like feeling. It has five-star chefs and three boat dives offered to you on a daily basis. The resort is very small and only holds 55 people with enough staff to meet your every need. I say this is a great place to go for a water lover, scuba diver or book reader. I would wake up every day to a gourmet breakfast, go for a quick swim in the 85 degree water, eat lunch and then enjoy a nice massage in their spa. It is the best place to unwind and hang with people you love.

Because in the days since Messrs. Obama and Biden took turns praising Mr. Corzine, it's been revealed that the company Mr. Corzine led was ripping off investors left and right. Oh, and he seems to have lost $1.2 billion. If Mr. Corzine ever goes to trial, the judge should take into account the millions of Americans who have lost all or part of their pensions because of the negligence and/or corruption of people like him.

What I want to remember most is that I, we, aren't entitled to live this next year. Perhaps that sounds dramatic, but as a nurse and a person who has lived long enough to experience tragedy, I know from experience that nothing is certain and every moment and day we're given is precious. I continue to find that many of the things I take for granted crumble away to nothing. But we don't have to think about what we lack to realize what we have: even if it's not a hoard of opened gifts filling out closets, garages, or drawers. We have each been given so much that was never ours to begin with.

Vovkovinskiy apologizes to "anyone who thought I was mean." He hopes this chapter of his life will soon be over.
The cat was already out of the bag a little, as the Nets' announcement had been upstaged by the internet. The team's logo, created by part-owner Jay-Z, leaked out last week on Deadspin, and soon after, photos popped up of neatly arranged shirts and hats.

In the mid-1970s, she began to focus less on music and more on feminism and her own stunning brand of liberation politics, becoming an editor and writer at the Village Voice and later founding the Cultural Reporting and Criticism program at NYU. Her writing is rigorous, unrelenting, in your face: not in the sense of mindless provocation but because she was so smart. "Students and colleagues fondly describe her as shy," recalled Robert Christgau in a 2007 tribute, "but she wasn't shy — she was thinking, and ignoring you."

A good leader hires people that cover areas that they don't have time to become efficient in."

It smacked of the five-year-old making up stories to cover her tracks, incensed that the rest of the world refuses to buy into her "aliens did this to my room" story.

Some have suggested that the move to AVI has nothing to do with funding our schools, that linking the two is little more than a political distraction. We respectfully disagree. In cities, counties, boroughs and townships across the country, property taxes are the critical linchpin to funding public education. Homeowners have a vested interest in assuring that children in their community receive a quality education, have a fair shot at a good-paying job and ultimately end up reinvesting in the neighborhood. That is why people who can, when they have children, move out of the city to the Pennsylvania suburbs or New Jersey, where the taxes are much higher but schools are much better because of the larger investment.

Still, the state suffers under a stigma: the notion that wine can't be made in the desert. That Arizona wine is a gimmick that belongs in the gift shop with the scorpions embedded in Lucite.

So I responded by sharing some stories about God's desire to be in covenant relationship with the world. I shared the story of the prophet Hosea, whose wife was a prostitute. Their relationships became an allegory for Yahweh's relentless pursuit of Israel. I shared stories of Jesus dining with those others had excluded - sinners, tax collectors, prostitutes. I reminded my young friend that Christ stood by the woman caught in adultery and said, "Let those without sin cast the first stone."

Reductions get harder from here. Some of America's most expansive military commitments are not made in the Middle East but rather in the military's health care, compensation and retirement systems. Health costs in the defense budget have risen from $19 billion in 2001 to more than $50 billion today. The military retirement system is appropriately generous. But the possibility of retiring at age 37 with full benefits -- following 20 years of service -- seems generous beyond normal bounds.

She's contemplating legislation to make the use of investor visas illegal for state projects, saying it sounds like we're selling citizenship and "turning the country over to the Chinese."

(1) CVS supervisor Fenton Graham, 35, of Silver Spring, Md., was arrested as the inside man (with two accomplices) in two drugstore robberies in April. Surveillance video showed that, in the second heist, the nervous perp evidently failed to take the money with him, and Graham was seen taking it out to his forgetful partner.

According to police, Voss first took the quarters and half-dollars ($3,000 worth), then days later he returned for $700 in dimes and nickels. By the third break-in, the resident had installed surveillance video, and Voss was caught as he came back for a bucket of pennies.

With a Senate committee hearing tomorrow, the General Assembly begins its debate over same-sex marriage, an issue that has closely divided the state. Polls suggest that Maryland residents support and oppose legalizing gay unions in about equal numbers. Advocates, including Gov.Martin O'Malley, met in Baltimore over the weekend in preparation for an effort to win over the crucial few votes in the House of Delegates that eluded them last year. And tonight, opponents of the measure are scheduled to rally in front of the State House in hopes of once again derailing the bill. But despite all the passion on both sides of the debate, it boils down to this: Gay marriage is a matter of fairness, of individual liberty and of strengthening Maryland families.

Senators also approved various other changes to the bill, reducing the types of drugs that would be tracked and the length of time the information would be kept in the database.

* I like the Rams' expensive signing of cornerback Cortland Finnegan. I really do. Pro Football Focus had him rated as the third-best CB in the league last season -- sixth against the pass, and second against the run. And he played more snaps than any corner in the NFL last season, a big plus for a team that had CBs dropping with injuries throughout 2011. Finnegan can cover outside, in the slot, is an aggressive tackler and plays with an edge that borders on psycho. He'll help coach Jeff Fisher re-set the Rams' mindset and make the defense more tenacious. And the Rams had an urgent need at corner.

It must seem like that every week in Harlan County. Quarles is surely turning out to be a devil in a three-piece suit, and his reputation has caught up with him. Givens quotes his rap sheet to him in the first scene and mentions his "propensity for toolin' up male hustlers. Is that why you're here?" the lawman asks the crook. "In exile?"

A five-mile return trip lay before us, and the storms showed no signs of abating, but we didn’t mind. We had logged 40 miles without a wreck, a squabble or even a flat tire, with some great food in the bargain.

So I readjusted my snorkel, inhaled and pumped down toward the reef. Some members of our 19-member sailing expedition were already there, peering into an orange coral bigger than an armchair. That meant the creature was not lethal. But it did look hungry. Half hidden in a crevice loomed a long speckled predator, jaws agape.

The biggest shock to my system, though, has been no fast food. I figured the Cavaliers would trade LeBron before I went six straight days without fast food. It's not that I've eaten it every day since I was introduced to it, but my average over the last 20 years probably has been 3-4 trips per week. Think of the cost and the lard.

Set in South Africa, the story pivots around a murder that pits a black family led by a pastor (Chuck Cooper) against a white one led by a landowner (Daniel Gerroll). You've got the makings of a well-meaning, melodramatic tearjerker right there, and common wisdom is that Anderson's book is clunky.

As some of the water vaporizes, the engine metal loses heat in a process called evaporative cooling, like sweat cooling the skin. Eventually the metal's temperature drops to the freezing point and ice accumulates. When ice shards slough off, they can choke airflow into the compressor, causing the engine to surge or stall. They also may quench the engine's combustor, causing a flameout, or complete failure. Vibration and mechanical damage may occur if breakaway ice fragments slam into the engine's rapidly spinning blades.

Dunham taps a strain of self-loathing beneath the boldness. Ancient feminists may wonder how she can be ruthless about the humiliations and failures of herself as Hannah, the main character, and still be proudly female-centric?

THOMAS: Yes, they can ask the grandmother about her status. The police need no reasonable suspicion or probable cause to ask any question of any person, so long as officers do not create the impression that answers are required. The police may be able to determine the grandmother's immigration status simply by asking her questions like where she was born and how she came to the U.S. If the grandmother does not admit to being undocumented, law enforcement may still determine immigration status based on a totality of the circumstances. Relevant considerations include clothing, language used and accent, the location of the encounter, origin and destination of travel and behavior of the individuals.

Lang said the board could consider several proposals in June: set a cap on tuition set-aside, shift academic scholarships to university foundations that raise private money, and ask the Legislature to pay for need-based scholarships. Under the last scenario, the Legislature could have the authority to select income cut-offs that allow more middle-class families to receive tuition assistance, he said.
David Donnelly, national campaigns director for the Public Action fund, said past practice is a poor precedent. It's especially important to show Americans now that the supercommittee, making "monumental decisions that will affect every American for years to come," will operate free of outside influence, he said.
The roller coaster of inflation followed by recession is out of control. In the last 12 years, leaders of both parties have tried in vain to slow its reckless course. At the same time, states compete with each other to extract more and more federal grants that are financed out of the deficits and not the productivity of the nation. It is, therefore, right that these same states join together to demand a constitutional amendment that will serve as the occasion for finally restraining the inflationary spending of the federal government. The nation, no less than the individual states, must eventually balance its books. The excuse that only annual deficits promote full employment is refuted by the continuing decline in productivity and investment which form the only true base of long term employment.

Personally, I liked the HBO documentary "Runnin' Rebels of UNLV" better than "Fab Five." A shame it's being so overshadowed by the film about a team that -- unlike UNLV -- did not win a national title, despite all the hype.

That all these numbers describe the same situation reflects how different relative and absolute risk can look. Relative risk tells us how many times more prevalent an outcome or characteristic—death, or lacking an ID—is among one group compared with another. The absolute number tells us how much being a member of the group at greater risk increases that risk.

Rose's teammates tried to offer some comforting words as the trainer and assistant trainer helped him off the court.
ESPN analyst Tom Jackson on Trent Richardson: "He's that rare back who can be on the field all three downs because he's so good at catching the ball out of the backfield. But I think the thing that is most impressive when you watch him on film, when you watch him in games: He is a finisher. Every single down you watch him carry the ball, there are two or three yards at the end of it that will be positive yards for the Cleveland Browns.''

Linda Wilson: I believe the construction you are referring to is the city of Webster Groves project to replace the Murdoch bridge over the railroad just north of I-44. This construction has closed Murdoch starting Monday of this week. It also closed one of the ramps to I-44. Traffic is using other roads so that is probably why you are seeing more traffic on Laclede Station.
Of course, water is not the only way to imbibe fluids. A little flavor added to water perks up the taste buds. While it may be common to see sliced lemon or orange added to a pitcher of water, another refresher is cucumber with flavor harder to identify than you would expect. Fruits and vegetables are also handy retainers of fluid.
The results, Smith said in the statement, were better than he expected.
The company moved several years ago to a 10,000-square-foot facility in Green Island that still has the feel of a startup: an old industrial asparagus blancher pasteurizes the feedstock, and the mycelium is applied with a machine that once put chocolate chips on cookies.

Kiwanuka recently signed a three-year extension worth $21.75 million, with $10.95 million in guaranteed money. If Umenyiora is correct that the Giants’ offer to him was for about $5 million in guaranteed money it is not close to what he is looking for.

Though it's difficult to prove the truth of such a statement -- there's no single repository of statistics on what sorts of wines people drink here -- anecdotal evidence has affirmed for me, over the years, that this is fact. We may be the 29th most populous metropolis in the U.S., but when I visit other cities, I'm generally disappointed to find fewer Italian offerings, from older vintages, on store shelves.

-- When I said the Giants had issues covering the middle of the field, I didn't mean they had nobody covering between the numbers. But that's exactly what happened late in the second quarter when Colston was all by himself up the middle of the field. And of course, that's the ball he drops, right? Colston was targeted six times all night; four of them came on that drive. The drop was the only incompletion. The rest were his only catches of the night: 50, 13 and 15 yards.

Anton Khudobin (who turns 26 on Monday) could be waiting in the wings at Providence (AHL), with a brief-but-impressive NHL resume of seven games (5-1-0, 1.32 GAA, .961 save percentage).

He has good top-end speed and acceleration in the open field, but struggles to get enough burst to separate in short areas. An elongated stride makes it difficult for him to run sharp routes. Much of his production came from making plays at the point of the catch and after; he doesn't get himself open through route-running. He is an all-or-nothing blocker who can't recover after whiffing, and will have to improve in that area. His stride hampers his ability to change direction and could be his biggest problem in the NFL, where he'll be covered by premier athletes.

Then what about "vigilante?" Again to the dictionary, which says a vigilante is a group or individual volunteering to promote an interest, or to suppress and punish crime. That seems to me the exact definition of what the Minutemen claim as their purpose.

But the aura isn't skill or craft. It's place. European wines, by and large, have a sense of coming from somewhere rather than being fashioned in some manner or style.

Why wouldn't you do that? It has nothing to do with building for the future, I think it's just smart. The more draft picks you have the better off you are going to be. Everyone knows it's a crap shoot sometimes. The more chances you have in there the better chances you are going to get a good player. I'll always feel that way. Now, to trade just to trade, I don't think we've ever done that and I would never do that. I don't care what our record or depth is or any of that stuff. If there is a good football player we are going to take him, unless someone offers something that makes sense for us."
And in a delicious twist, it seems that the broadest possible audience includes the United States, with more than 100 American public radio stations broadcasting CBC Radio programs.
"We remain concerned that consumers will stay on the sidelines during this economic recovery," Capital Economics said in a research note. "Weak jobs growth, low wages growth and tight credit mean that any further acceleration in consumption growth is unlikely."

You can order the kiddie version of mac and cheese for $3.25, or you can go over the top with the Clubhouse's Ghetto Mac, a customer-inspired dish of macaroni and cheese, ground beef, onions, green pepper and jalapeños with an egg on top. $7.25.
At 6-feet-3, Ronald Hearns, who lives in Southfield, has inherited his dad's height, reach and explosiveness, though perhaps not the same deadly punching power with either hand.
``It was hard,'' Lowe said. ``Obviously, in a perfect world, you go 1-2-3 and run back out there. But the hitters don't care what's going on. They want to go out there and get RBIs, get hits.''
Pastor of the Morning Star Baptist Church, Rev. Benjamin Mike, prayed for the spiritual well being of the community and the relationship God requires of each of us. As he spoke his words of inspiration and truth resonated through the ears of the people in the room.

Do you agree with this choice? Or do you think there's an individual who would have made a better selection? Time magazine is not the arbiter of what matters and what doesn't, but its choices for Person fo the Year have often generated heated discussions.
To be clear, this isn't about denominations, or about premodern or postmodern sensibilities, or about being a cafeteria Christian (someone who can pick and choose those teachings they want to follow) or about "getting medieval" or rediscovering the Celtic influence in our spiritual disciplines. Rather it is about two ancient and ongoing streams of thought or attitude, one of incarnation and appreciation and the other of detachment and asceticism (although those are imperfect labels at best).
Both men also face drug charges in connection with marijuana allegedly found in their rooms, authorities said.
"We can play better, and we will play better," pronounced coach Marty Schottenheimer.
James, there may be another reason for Israeli leaders' reticence about their Gaza objectives: Those objectives are illegal under international law. Had even Israel's claim of self-defense over the rockets been justified, self-defense is a limited right and only authorizes such force as is necessary to redress the harm suffered by the state invoking it. The objectives you outline -- uprooting Hamas, destroying its infrastructure and so on -- are political, not military, objectives and exceed the scope of legitimate self-defense. Armed attacks not justified by self-defense constitute crimes against international peace.
Extreme pessimists were rare. Only two people predicted that GDP will shrink this year, which would mean we're about to enter a new recession. Thirteen said the Dow will fall for the year.

Most of these hard feelings could have been averted with better communication.
By one estimate, rental units make up more than 40 percent of the housing in the area, and a large proportion of those made homeless by the storm were low-income tenants who lacked insurance.

A: It's like everything has been put in my path, with God's grace. It's been totally life-changing. The advantage you have with being on the show is it takes away all the distractions of everyday life. People think it's all about these hard workouts, and that's part of it. But I have said this is about 10 percent physical and 90 percent mental. You don't have to worry about your family, your bills, you don't have to worry about anything but yourself while you're there. It opens up a whole new view of yourself. There's no one else to make excuses to. My dad always said you can lie to anyone you want, but you cannot lie to yourself. Going through this process has allowed me to get honest.

Iran, the world's fourth-largest oil producer, has long viewed its oil reserves as a leverage point with the West—and has shown confidence that the West needs its oil as much as it needs the revenue.
The science: A study by Typhoo tea finds that every day at 2:16 — about two hours after lunch — you're going to hit your energy slump and head to your nearest 'Bucks. The biggest problem is that you may be in the middle of an important meeting and can't take a coffee run. The other issue is the caffeine, which stays in your system for eight hours. So if you're planning a 9 or 10 p.m. bedtime, your midday energy slump may interfere.

Once projected as one half of a modified right field platoon with Jon Jay, Allen Craig will now be exposed at third base during spring training as support for projected starter David Freese.
Clearing away the clutter gives rise to new ways of understanding how situations occur to people. For example, look at congregations that have ceased to be effective in their ministry. They are not growing-in fact, they are cluttered. Perhaps not cluttered with books and stacks of paper (though I have seen some that are), but cluttered instead by ideas of how things used to be, cluttered by ideas that no longer work, cluttered with grief over the loss of members. Their default future is dim indeed.

Good story.
Ibanez erased the lead with a drive to right off his former Seattle teammate with two outs in the sixth.
Stark has personified all the things that are wrong with Washington. A gerrymandered district loaded with Democrats protected him from losing to a Republican; until now, no serious Democrat dared challenge him. No matter what Stark said, no matter how much his antics shamed Congress, Stark knew no fear of losing re-election; he knew only arrogance and entitlement.
Some of the top fundraisers as of June 30 include Supervisor Carmen Chu. She was appointed last year by Mayor Gavin Newsom after removing Ed Jew from office. Jew faces criminal charges that he took bribes and lied about living in District Four, largely made up of the Sunset neighborhood.
"A little bit," might be an understatement, considering Dunn was 1-for-18 against southpaws entering the night. Add to the fact that Dunn hadn't seen the change-up/fastball lefty in Milone, and Ventura made sure to keep the veteran as far away from the pitcher as he could.
The Gaylord project will have 1,500 rooms and 400,000 square feet of conference facilities, making it the only combined hotel conference center of its kind in Colorado.

Said Juergen of Menlo Park, "I was a bit surprised that New Braunfels, Texas (love Oma's Restaurant) was omitted because its history is rich with German heritage, particularly from those immigrants who hail from my Frankfurt area stamping grounds.

As a consequence, the Democrats could easily be looking at a bloodbath next year, particularly Downstate. The House Democrats caught a break in 2010 when the Republicans wasted most of their energy in suburban Cook County. The Republicans could've picked up a lot more seats if they had fielded decent Downstate candidates and spent more cash in the region. They're not making the same mistake this time around.

Customers share family news with an always-professional staff. The fabric of community strengthens. My most recent trip to the Ivy speaks volumes (no pun intended).

They are last and are eliminated from the competition. There are now only five teams left racing around the globe for a million dollars.
In "Rin Tin Tin: The Life and the Legend," Susan Orlean has fashioned a masterpiece of reporting and storytelling, some of it quite personal and all of it compelling.

This week, he cranks up the projector for another session in the Grimm Tales of Fractured History Film Festival, and finds that the Verrat Hundjagers were aligned with the monarchists and Franco's army during the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s. A Grimm correspondent from back then filmed and narrates footage showing Verrat forces executing innocent Wesen.

But that's led to a patchwork of exceptions and conflicting rulings -- a mess worsened by the fact that the federal executive branch (mainly the State Department) fiercely resists such efforts to seek justice, as of course do the accused states. All of which has created a legal nightmare for those looking to collect -- and for those seeking to deter terror-enablers.

career expectations. It has not been a stellar season for the switch-hitting shortstop, and that was true with the Dodgers as it has been with the Cardinals. But he can bring the glove. Since his first inning with the Cardinals, Furcal has improved his plus/minus scores to his right and to his left. He has, as you probably saw, increased the range the Cardinals have at shortstop, to the position's left and to the right.

We are adjusting, but everything is scary with a preemie. There is so much to figure out, and we get startled at every noise she makes. Apparently preemies grunt a lot, so it was hard getting used to all of her sounds without being afraid of them. We didn't sleep a wink the first night. But now I know that not every grunt means she's suffocating. We also have a home health care professional who comes to the house. One of the NICU nurses even baby-sat for us so we could go to my brother's wedding the weekend after we got home. We are able to call the NICU nurses all of the time if we have questions, and they are so helpful.
‘‘I think Shaka is very pleased with where the contract is right now,'' VCU athletic director Norwood Teague told the Richmond Times-Dispatch in its Sunday editions. ‘‘We'll talk at the end of the year if anything needs to be changed.''

The main value for consumers is in the convenience and transparency the exchanges provide. No longer would they have to wander from agent to agent (or website to website) to find out what their options were. Nor would they have to try to translate each insurer's fine print to measure the total value of its policies. Enabling consumers to compare services and prices should remove some of the artificial barriers to competition in insurance and make it harder for companies to raise premiums.

Their extra-base power. The Cards lead the league in homers, slugging percentage, and isolated power despite having lost a player (Pujols) with the fourth-best all-time career slugging percentage. They have six everyday players with slugging percentages above .500, seven if you count Matt Carpenter. To put that into context, the MV3 lineup of 2004 (which led the NL in scoring by a wide margin) only had four regulars who slugged above .500 ---- and that was in an era when overall scoring was higher than it is today. The Cards are on pace to bash 236 homers, or 22 more than the MV3 team amassed. Unless I'm mistaken, that would be the highest one-year total in franchise history.

2. Robert Griffin III, QB, Baylor, 6-2, 223. Quality arm strength, 4.41 speed in the 40-yard dash and the Redskins are so excited he's on the way they've already dispatched offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan to Waco, Texas, several times to meet with him. His ability to throw, with accuracy, on the move to the left or right makes him a perfect fit for Mike Shanahan's offense.

Every Southwestern road trip requires some seriously vertical scenery, so our first stop was Fish River Canyon, two days' drive south of Windhoek. It's practically unheard of outside Namibia, but the scale at Fish River is second only to the Grand Canyon. Here, though, there are no acres of parking, tourist-packed buses or IMAX theaters — just a small, deserted viewing platform. You're free to wander as far as you like along the unfenced canyon rim, alone with your thoughts on what might as well be the edge of the world.

Playing guitar, Jurvanen leads a unique band consisting only of drums and two female vocalists. This establishes musical freedom and the ability to extend sections from his beautiful records "Pink Strat," released in 2009, and the new "Barchords." He plays in the moment.

However, with a few bucks and a little luck, the Derby can be the best 2 minutes of your sports year (provided you stick to legal wagering outfits, of course). Or even if you don't bet a dime, you can't help but get swept up in everyone else's emotions as the ponies sprint for home.

Manning's first offseason of preparation in Denver — minicamps and organized team activities — will come under a microscope. Of course, it's arguable that Manning is used to that, but is he? He no longer will be in Indianapolis. He is succeeding not just Elway, but the Disney-esque Tim Tebow, the quarterback Elway cheered while on camera, but never truly embraced. Manning is going to be subjected to a new level of attention.
What we like about our contractors is that they design it, they build it and they maintain it. We're part of that process, to avoid rework and change orders compared to the nonunion competition.

And I think organized labor is an important part of that.

øOther options are also unlocked as you play through the game - rhythm toys, new music, unending games and the two-player mode. In the latter, two players compete head to head on the same screen using two remotes. However, unlocking some of these options won't mean anything until you play the mini-games with such precision that you earn medals.

Then a couple of snappy variations are separated by one for strings alone, which sounds a bit like the blues with low, slow bass lines merging with overlapping melodies higher up.

But he can still overwork looks. Nina says he can be borderline costume-y. But Michael liked that Seth Aaron knew he was putting on a show. Nina admires Seth Aaron's guts, and that he's "more fearless," than the others. Emilio went more quiet, they say, with a collection that looked like it was ready to be sold, but didn't have the showstopper quality they look for in a runway presentation, which then gets tamed a bit for commercial production. "Where was the drama?" Michael asks. The choice comes down to who is the most creative? Who has the most to say?

What happened in that split second on the football field that day so long ago at Plymouth-Whitemarsh had not just shattered the still-unlived life of Buddy Miley.

Friends Buddy had played ball with as a youth found that their lives were no longer the same. And there was a woman in Alabama who had befriended Buddy — Karen Kollmeyer (then Karen Shields).

The anti-bank campaign has in fact been incubating for years -- a "seed beneath the snow," as the Italian novelist Ignazio Silone once termed the slow-to-arrive left. The sit-ins, teach-ins and street demonstrations popping up in Boston, Chicago, Seattle, San Francisco and Los Angeles are formally the handiwork of a coalition of community groups that recently gathered together as the New Bottom Line. Many of these groups have focused on immediate goals -- such as stopping particular banks from foreclosing on more homes. They, along with unions, have demonstrated on Wall Street many times since the 2008 financial crisis. But only now, as Occupy Wall Street -- an organization that they didn't create -- has grabbed the public imagination the past few weeks, are the myriad mobilizations commanding the media's attention.

His stuff didn't look any different tonight than it does any other day."

There's also a bar area, a sushi bar, and - take note, wedding planners - a private dining room. Eventually, the restaurant will do its own brewing as well.

Just let me say here, at my age, it isn't easy because the older you get the harder it is to take it off, sort of like gray hair and wrinkles. Only worse because gray hair and wrinkles can be covered up to some extent, but that stubborn spare tire around the middle and those love handles just expand with the clothes.
Families of the victims were upset at his testimony.
Ireland and his sports-talk partner, Steve Mason, still think the Chargers are the likeliest candidates, but, Mason added, "The fact that Minnesota has struggled to put together a stadium proposal because of the amount of public dollars that are required, that raises the stakes a little bit.''

* William Buford on whether Deshaun Thomas wants the ball in games like that one, when he's hot.
There's nothing subtle about Giambi, from his tattoos to his biceps to a mustache that he can seemingly grow between innings. He brings swagger into the batter's box. He clubbed 13 home runs last season in a part-time role, and the Rockies exercised his $1 million option this season to get roughly 30 games at first base in between pinch-hit at-bats.

Two big caveats: The College Board math assumes everyone goes to a public college. Those usually cost less than private ones—often a lot less—and that skews returns higher. The report also doesn't account for dropouts or extra college years. Only 56% of students who enroll in a four-year college earn a bachelor's degree within six years, according to a report last year by the Harvard Graduate School of Education.

In Antawn Jamison, they have a frustrated player. The power forward, who leads the team in shots, finished with 10 points on just 3-of-7 from the floor. He attempted just three field goals in a first half that ended with Atlanta holding a 61-42 lead.
Lowe's scouting report on the Angels might be a little dated. This year's team has done very little to create offense. It's hard to go first to third -- when no one's on first. They put the leadoff man on base just once in nine innings and that was Kendrys Morales, hardly a candidate to do anything crazy on the basepaths. For the season, the Angels have put the leadoff man on base in just 55 of their 197 innings and have worked him around to score just 19 times.

It was good but served at a temperature that was a little too cool and had to be sent back for rewarming. The staff graciously offered a whole new plate.

Join locals at Chocolateria San Gines for thick-as-pudding hot chocolate and doughnut-like churros.

National Football League Commissioner Roger Goodell has laid a crushing hit on the New Orleans Saints, suspending Head Coach Sean Payton for a year and General Manager Mickey Loomis for half a season, fining the club $500,000 and taking away two high draft picks. Former Saints Assistant Coach Gregg Williams, newly hired to run the St. Louis Rams defense, has been suspended indefinitely. These are the stiffest penalties ever imposed on a team and its key personnel -- and Goodell was absolutely right to do it.
"I think at the time we imposed the moratorium, it was an appropriate time to impose a moratorium," Ogg said.

A German-French-British production, "The Three Musketeers" doesn't worry much about dialogue or accents. Perhaps expecting to earn most of their money from dubbed versions, the filmmakers allow Lerman to speak American amid a mostly British cast, and let their devious French cardinal use a Germanic lilt to deliver such feeble bons mots as "evil's just a point of view."
Speaking after ECB policymakers met under tight security in hard-hit Spain, Draghi said Thursday that the best way to lasting recovery would be a long-term, Europe-wide push on deep economic reforms.
Even by his high standards, Springsteen, who will bring his band to Madison Square Garden on Friday and Monday, has something special going on right now — and he’s acting like he knows it. All his bets have come in. Asking the untried Jake Clemons to stand in for his late, legendary uncle was a risky move, but night after night, the young saxophonist demonstrates that he’s a natural showman with ample reserves of self-confidence. The "new" 18-piece E Street Band could have been a train wreck of clashing treble, bass and percussion; instead, the musicians have been so enthusiastic and mutually respectful that the enormous arrangements somehow feel intimate. The confrontational populist politics of the "Wrecking Ball" album could have turned off fans weary of endless debate; instead, the new songs are getting cheers.
The centers can't replace primary care doctors, who focus more on continuity of care, especially for chronic conditions. But they have carved out a vital niche, said Lou Ellen Horwitz, executive director of the Urgent Care Association of America, based in Warrenville, Ill.

About 20 percent of women and 6 percent of men experience rape or attempted rape while in college, according to the National Institute of Justice.

Despite historically low mortgage rates, few Americans are prepared to buy a home as the economy fizzles and job growth is stagnant.
Jon Huntsman also appears to be taking a powder on Iowa. He's planning to focus his resources on New Hampshire, South Carolina and Florida. They're open-primary states and Huntsman is gambling that he can attract enough independents -- especially since there won't be a Democratic contest to vie for their attention -- to break from the field. Let's just say it's an interesting theory, and maybe the best one available to him. One recent poll puts him last in the GOP field and another says he's the least-known GOP contender. Huntsman's hoping that by doing well with independents, he can convince Republicans in later primary states that he is their best bet to defeat Obama. Polls indicate that even some very conservative GOP voters may put electability ahead of ideology in 2012.
This has happened before. Apparently I am highly allergic to this plant and it just so happens I decided to pull a few weeds without wearing gloves.

We called our book "Crackback!" because that's a term for an illegal football block, one that a defender never sees coming because it comes from behind him unexpectedly.

Santana pitched. He struck out five, allowed two hits and two walks, and tried to push his luck by talking his way into a sixth inning that Collins, smartly, was never going to agree to. Santana took a no-decision, the Mets finally scratching a run off Tommy Hanson in the sixth and winning 1-0 and improving their Opening Day record to a remarkable 33-18.

I returned this year and was predictably not made a shooting star. In a way this is a good thing, because with a $5,000 bounty on your head, everyone is looking for any excuse to get you all in. If you happen to be a total card-rack that day, then you'll likely have an extra-good day, but otherwise, you're usually dodging a whole table full of people with even more incentive to cut your throat than usual.

Answer: We look for ideas everywhere and anywhere. We come across companies all the time that may have two, or even zero, analysts covering them. We try to get as much information as we possibly can about a company. You have to talk to their competitors, talk to people shorting their stock.

Then, I found out that wasn’t the case and we just got to build her from the ground up, which was great. I was mostly really excited about doing it because of Will Reiser’s writing, plus the kind of unexpected humor in really honest situations. It wasn’t a cancer movie with dark jokes about cancer.

TE Jake Ballard. You’re seeing the evolution of coverage against him, in that it was zone early in the season when he kept finding soft spots and defenders were running away from him. Now, you’re seeing man and he’s still being effective. Pretty soon, you’ll see defenders trying to disrupt him getting off the line.

As I said in our postgame video, it’s one thing to make grabs in zone coverage when you’re ignored; it’s quite the other to make a catch like he did with a man under him and one on top of him.

And in Calgary, the Blues jumped on a slumping team with two opportunistic goals on the power play.

We treat our children, who end up specializing in one sport at a young age, like professional athletes, he said. Some children will end up playing one sport year-round while even pro athletes get an offseason to recover and recuperate. Hyman has talked to doctors who say they've seen young athletes unable to tell their parents they want to stop playing to the extent that they develop psychosomatic injuries as a way to escape a sport. If you ask a child why he or she plays a sport, the most common response is because they want to have fun. When did parents lose sight of that simple goal?

* Given some of the speculative numbers being thrown around on the pending new contract extension for Yadier Molina, he'd become one of the highest-paid catchers in MLB history. Understand that there's no way this deal happens if Albert Pujols is still here, making more than $20 million guaranteed annually over the next 10 seasons.

A huge problem facing the Transportation Trust Fund is that billions of dollars of motorist-paid funds (gas tax, titling tax, vehicle registration and Motor Vehicle Administration fees) are being spent supporting two major mass transit systems, with 50 percent of TTF funds spent just on transit operating costs. Fares paid by transit riders cover only a fraction of the operating costs, yet mass transit systems handle less than 10 percent of local travel, while highways and bridges are choked with the remaining 90 percent. This is not sustainable. Out-of-control operating costs must be contained and other, broader-based funding sources identified to separate mass transit operating spending from highway spending.

Can our leaders reform and reauthorize the No Child Left Behind law? How do they get the economy moving, while helping the jobless, the hungry, those whose homes have been foreclosed, and the growing numbers of the poor and struggling? Can they unite to hasten the end of civil wars and brutal dictatorships in Libya and Syria? Can Congress renew the nation's roads and transportation legislation, which expires next month, or end the Federal Aviation Administration shutdown? Can the protagonists of the debt ceiling brawl lay down their gloves and accomplish anything of importance? The Senate and White House offer more glimmers of hope than the House.

So Tressel could have lied then, covered up that instead. Before the 2007 national title game against Florida, an Ohio State player failed a drug test that came with a mandatory suspension, and he did not play.

The concept of "feeling younger" can be misleading: People usually mean that they feel healthier than they expected to feel at a particular age, not that they're denying their age or yearning for youth, said Laura Carstensen, founding director of the Stanford Center on Longevity. When asked in studies how old they'd like to be, most people say they wish to be 10 years younger — 70-year-olds want to be 60, 60-year-olds wish to be 50 — because they'd be healthier. No one wants to be 20, she said.

"Look, so many pagodas in Bagan," said our driver, Tun. "If you built a pagoda, your sins would be forgiven. The bigger the sin, the bigger the pagoda," he explained on our way to our first temple after picking us up at the tiny Bagan airport. The structures range in size from 3 feet high to the tallest, the 17-story Thatbyinnyu, to the largest, the Dhammayangyi Temple, which was built in the 12th century by a ruler with a guilty conscience: He smothered his ailing father, who was the king, and then killed his older brother so he could be the ruler.

The organization has fielded thousands of calls without incident, and it has received numerous awards for its efforts from local and state law enforcement officials. Only one of the brothers, Eliyahu, was a Shomrim member, and he was suspended immediately after his encounter with Mr. Ausby. He is no longer a member of the group. Despite some calls for it to be disbanded immediately following the confrontation between the Werdesheims and Mr. Ausby, Shomrim has quietly gone about its business. The whole group should not be tainted by one former member's poor judgment.

Beyond that, Eugenides said, is that that period of beginning anew is filled with experiences that many of us share. And they can be very challenging. "I found things very, very difficult," he said. "I remember then and wanted to describe that period of life."
Go without shoes on my front lawn, and the bottom of your feet will turn to ground chuck, red and raw from sharp stems and the saw-edged blades of crab grass, thistle and those nasty weeds with the needle leaves.
In addition to memory, the study has multiple other components: How officers approach and talk to suspects, where they retreat to when a gun is pulled, how they duck below the car for cover, how fast their hearts beat throughout.

If there is a defense equipped to stop Michael Vick, it's the Bears. They proved as much during a 31-26 win on Nov. 28 that wasn't as close as the score indicated. The Bears are quick and disciplined defensively. They kept Vick in front of them and forced him to run around in cold weather on slick sod trying to throw touch passes over Brian Urlacher's head.
The DBS' suspension system and the traction control each have a track (or sport) mode, and drivers can also use a third "Sport" button that sharpens throttle response, decreases the transmission's shift times and opens up the exhaust for more voluminous sound above 3,700 rpm.

During the 1989 season, the media began to ask the coach at his daily press briefings: “What’s the matter with Lawrence?” From that moment on, all week long the coach stopped calling him Lawrence. He would say things like “Hey, ‘What’s the Matter With,’ can you come over here a minute?” Or “Good morning, ‘What’s the Matter With,’ how do you feel today?” He even said it in front of other players in the locker room.

But he passed the ball back to a trailing Gerald Wallace, who at the last second passed the ball back to Matthews.

And the warm weather couldn’t have come at a more opportune time as many public courses that usually sleep through January under a blanket of snow are still open. That’s a blessing after having struggled through a wet and wild 2010. From early spring floods, to Irene’s late-summer landfall, to the freak October snowstorm, golf courses lost prime playing time throughout the year.
"I remember all the losses, too," Showalter said. "It's about the players. It always has been. The significance is we won a game and we're trying to get closer to doing something good for our fans in Baltimore."

On the boat heading to the Pit Stop, Marcus laughs that this is the only time he gets applause for finishing fourth. The teams land at the destination of the final Pit Stop and start searching for the Floating Stadium, which is buried in the heart of the labyrinthine city. Jeremy and Sandy are the third team in. Right behind them are Laurence and Zac, who fell behind despite (or perhaps because of) having more marine navigation experience than any other team. Perhaps the producers weren't precise enough in their map-making skills to satisfy Zac, the youngest kid to ever circumnavigate the globe alone. Marcus and Amani are lost in the city, so Ernie and Cindy beat them for fifth place and they land in sixth. Liz and Marie complete the challenge quickly, but as they head to the Pit Stop, they know they are sailing to their doom. Bill and Cathi reach the Pit Stop in seventh place -- still in the race.

Mr. McQueen's bold creativity became evident when he enrolled in London's prestigious fashion school Central St. Martins. Jane Rapley, who was a dean of Central St. Martins at the time, remembers Mr. McQueen struggling with his fees and sometimes with coursework, since he had not had previous formal training. McQueen was down-to-earth and tough, she recalls. "There was an aggression in him," she says. "I think it grew out of his background, his ambition and his drive. He hadn't been used to moving in a whole range of social circumstances, he had things to prove."
"A UAV is going to be able to report vehicles or whatever the case may be," said Sgt. Augusto Zapata, a 26-year-old Marine scout sniper instructor at Quantico, referring to the acronym for drones.

Our dear nation stands at a crossroads. The direction we take will determine not what kind of nation we are but what kind of nation we will become. Will we become a nation which plots in secret to wage war? Will we become a nation that observes our Constitution only in matters of convenience? Will we become a nation which destroys the unity of the world community painstakingly pieced together from the ruins of World War II, a war which itself followed a war to end all wars?

These are dishes you know and love; DiIonno has artfully compiled a list of greatest hits (he’s been in the business 30 years). He executes them well, but also surprises you with his rendition.

In a basketball world where too many dreams are fueled by straight cash, sometimes we measure a player more by his ability to earn NBA checks than his potential to develop. The obvious hole in Roberson's game is his jump shot. Standing 6-7, he needs a serviceable one to thrive at small forward in the pros. But we sometimes forget that Roberson has yet to celebrate his 21st birthday, and he's far from fully grown as a player.

Yes, the radio station was held liable for the accident. Any contest that rewards unsafe driving is irresponsible. Food for thought." (Alan Wald)

The Kings have won seven straight on the road in the playoffs counting a pair against San Jose last spring and are in an enviable spot taking the series back to Los Angeles, with Game 3 Thursday night.

Someone like Santorum may see no troublesome contradiction here. Of course Bell was embraced by the Eastern, Ivy League, blah blah blah media establishment. The outrageous passages that can be plucked selectively and misinterpreted from his books don't contradict this; they prove it. That establishment is as dangerously left-wing and un-American as Bell was, and so is Obama. Even Gingrich probably holds a more nuanced view of the American political landscape, and Romney may sense that a general attack on the establishment is going to be a tough case for him to make.

Lawson, who was 11-of-17 from the field, also took the challenge of simply being better. In Game 1, the Lakers forced him to spots on the floor that severely impaired his impact — namely, away from the rim.

The score's pervasive rhythm, in a jaunty 6/8 time, keeps things moving forward (occasionally the music sounds like a 21st century gloss on Dukas' "Sorcerer's Apprentice"), and the wood-block samples provide a joyful counterpoint.

Their shoes, on the other hand, were just the right ones for their gaits, thanks to Trapp's guidance. She had advised them how to find the right shoes for running and also what to eat, and not eat, beforehand.

Lange's book is not alone in looking at St. Louis and soccer. Another recent book on American soccer history, "Distant Corners" by David Wangerin (Temple University Press), provides a different - more critical, less pictorial - take on the early days of St. Louis soccer.

Wangerin, a native Midwesterner who has lived in the United Kingdom for more than 20 years, also touches on some topics that Lange doesn't, such as the slightly dubious path Scullin Steel took to the 1921 Challenge Cup final.

The canoe glides past submerged boulders, cobblestones, trees and exposed roots. Around Sunrise Avenue, towering clay cliffs reveal thousands of years of geology. The river has carved strange mesa structures from clay so hard that it acts like bedrock. Clay defines the river as it cascades through the San Juan rapids, creating haystacks, eddies, whirlpools and boils. Seeking a balance between erosion and deposits, it cuts into the cliffs on one side and places gravel on the other. In high volume, the river wants to cut a deeper channel, but the clay resists. When it can't incise, the river widens. Up to the levees.
The Navy says the problems with LCS are typical of the first vessels in a new class of warship, and that the LCS's design is stable. Similar problems happened with the Perry frigates.

Tea leaves: Brancatelli’s colleagues see him as a key swing vote. He is one of the most respected members of the council for his encyclopedic knowledge of foreclosure and other home-lending issues. Sweeney made him chairman of the powerful Community and Economic Development Committee this year.

The week before, they galloped around Hollywood demanding their fair share of the profits from "Brokeback Mountain" director Ang Lee for "stealing" the idea of gay cowboys.

Just before Thanksgiving in 2009, then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger visited California troops in Iraq, heard horror stories about losing jobs, homes and families during deployments, and came away convinced they needed more help when they came back.

However, when a group sets out to impose its views on the rest of society by lobbying for public policies or laws, it can no longer claim special protections or an exemption from the norms of civil discourse simply because its views are formed by religious beliefs.

Ramsey also challenged the idea that the office is overstaffed. "We're at bare bones," he said.
Professional collaboration is also crucial. Your doctor must have the confidence and knowledge of what other providers are attempting to do with you to correct your problem. Dr. Paul M. Puziss, a Beaverton-based orthopedist for over 30 years, says, "I always maintain close contact with my patients' providers to help ensure continuity of care. For complex conditions like sciatica, it's crucial that patients are provided close guidance on appropriate exercises they're willing and able to do on their own to expedite recovery."

But even after excelling on the court, Elliott, who was already used to overcoming obstacles before winning a battle against a kidney disease in 1999, was still being overlooked.

And the lone competition Arizona had for Elliott's college commitment was UTEP.

She died two weeks later, in the early hours of a Sunday morning, wearing a sweat-drenched “I (Heart) Rudy” T-shirt. That previous morning she’d woke up and announced to her mother, Anna, “We have to get the children off to school,” because as the oldest of her siblings that’s what Katie did.

So there he was, making his play of the year with that fastbreak drive and lefty dunk over Kevin Durant in a big game with his playoff fire starting to glow red — a move Artest could've only dreamed of doing a year ago, when he couldn't get high enough to push a fastbreak layup over the front rim in Dallas.

To appreciate Tel Aviv's past, it's best to start at Rokach House in the Neve Zedek neighborhood. The endearing, copper cupola-topped house was built in 1887 by Shimon Rokach, whose family was established in the Holy Land when modern immigration accelerated, fueled by pogroms and Zionism.

This career allows me to do meaningful work. I find it so rewarding to watch children - my specialty is kindergarten through fifth graders - grow into their own understanding of their learning differences at an age appropriate level. I love teaching them how to advocate for themselves and giving them the tools needed to overcome their learning difficulties; I have the privilege of watching them evolve from a defeatist attitude to believing in themselves and their abilities.
She has found a kindred spirit in her boyfriend, Patrick Crowley. The last time Mr. Crowley bought a new phone five years ago, he told the salesman, "I want a phone that you could drop-kick into a lake and go get it and still be able to make a call." Mr. Crowley, 32, a hydrologist and co-founder of Chapul Inc., a health-food start-up, got a Casio G'zOne, then replaced it with an old, used model off Craigslist two years ago. He uses it only to make calls—and occasionally as a flashlight. When he comes home, he and Erica "don't want to be looking at our phones," he says. "We want to be cooking together and having face-to-face conversations."

The Wilson High version of "Ablaze" is something different, though. While retaining the same narrative premise, Zrebski rewrote and expanded it from a drama with a cast of eight to a musical with a cast of 23.

It was hard not to think about the decision DeChellis made last year while watching Kentucky beat Kansas for the national title Monday night. The Wildcats, you may have read everywhere, are a bunch of pros in training. John Calipari has, since his latter years as the coach at Memphis, built his team around one-and-done players who are forced by NBA rules to stop by a college campus for a year. Calipari is the subject of much ridicule by purists who still believe that all of college athletics is merely some sort of an addendum to the educational process. It isn't -- and hasn't been for a long, long, long time -- at Kentucky, or dozens of other places like it.

Your boyfriend could be more open-minded: It’s not just a kitchen; it’s a probiotics wildlife refuge. You point to the grout: “See this furry green patch? I’ve decided to name it ‘Pam.’” And sure, you could hire a weekly housecleaner with the money you’re saving by cohabiting and make filing systems and lists and chore wheels, but the reality is, you probably need somebody to follow you around with a shovel. Since you two were happy when you lived separately, the problem seems to be buying into the idea that moving in together is a step forward. For your relationship, the step forward would be living apart so you can go back to being lovingly amused at your differences -- the way he sees the countertop as half-full and you see that there’s still space for several pots and a week’s worth of dirty plates.
Then, as with oars and golf clubs, split cane quickly gave way to carbon fiber, made from polymers that have been stretched, oxidized and heated until all that's left is ribbons of mostly graphite glued together with resin. The fibers are amorphous, meaning that, although mostly parallel with the length of the rod, they twist and double back on each other.
The Rams will have forward Greg Smith back for the tournament game. He missed the MW Tournament because of a sprained ankle. In fact, the entire roster should be as healthy going into the Murray State game as it has been all season long.

With so many combinations, it's impossible to re-create each dish properly. Some classics such as pad thai ($9.95), basil salmon ($12.95) and tom kha gai ($8.95), a mildly spicy soup with sliced chicken and coconut milk, still have that classic balance, but other dishes are disjointed, and ingredients don't seem as fresh as they should.

Hegyes and nearly all of the original cast members reunited last year at the TV Land Awards to recognize the show's 35th anniversary.
As for checked bags, United, which charges $25 each way for the first bag and $35 for the second, applies its allowance to each seat. So if you book two seats and check two bags, your fees will total $50 instead of $60. Delta Air Lines has a similar policy. But Southwest, which doesn't charge for the first two bags, says that whether you occupy one or two seats, you can take only two bags for free.

The cottage cheese may sound a little off-putting, but it's a great trick for when you need thick, creamy and low-fat. With its relatively neutral flavor, cottage cheese can be combined with other ingredients, such as fresh herbs, to be used in place of mayonnaise, even as a sandwich spread.

"But second, we're also following the path of what happens if the plant closes in terms of getting federal help like Dr. Mongtomery can provide," Brown said. "And third, we're going to begin to look for what kind of company can go in there if in fact Twinsburg closes. Can we get wind turbine manufacturing, can we do something else there? "So we're always pursing all three of those: keeping the plant open, helping the workers adjust, and doing economic development in addition."

Joe Paul's advice was to tackle the project while drinking wine and to not be too particular about the application. That may be easy for an artistic talent like him, but not for a left-brain person like me who usually depends on a clear set of step-by-step directions for any project.
Franklin led all UCLA running backs with nine receptions last season. Bruins running backs caught a combined 21 passes last season. That number should jump significantly under Mazzone, who was coordinator at Arizona State in 2011.
MICDS starter Clayton Buddemeyer was strong out of the gate but started to fade after the third. Trailing 7-2, Sheinbein (who finished 3-for-5 with three RBI) drove in a run in the fourth inning to cut the MICDS lead to 7-3. Sheinbein eventually scored on a single from Lucas Tamaren to make it 7-4. Ladue finally chased Buddemeyer in the fifth inning when Gabe Grand's single plated Sandler and the Rams were within two runs, 7-5.

In some ways, CJ Entertainment America is mirroring the efforts of China Lion, which imports Mandarin-language productions and targets Chinese American audiences. Two years ago, China Lion's "If You Are the One 2" grossed $427,000 in the U.S., but many of its releases have failed to crack the $100,000 mark. The distributor said it has struggled to persuade potential ticket buyers to reject pirated videos and visit the multiplex.

The complexity lies in the fact that Palestinian moderates, like Prime Minister Salam Fayyad, see their future not in grand gestures but in day-to-day investment in the Palestinian people: infrastructure, education, business. Of course, they continue to demand justice from the Israelis, especially the end of the occupation. But at the same time, they look for seemingly insignificant moves that actually make a difference, like the right to create banks.
BENGHAZI, Libya — The U.S. fired more than 100 cruise missiles from the sea while French fighter jets targeted Moammar Gadhafi's forces from the air today, launching the broadest international military effort since the Iraq war in support of an uprising that had seemed on the verge of defeat.
"Universities tend to view these cases as misbehavior, as teaching moments," said David Lisak, a psychologist at the University of Massachusetts' Boston campus and an expert on campus violence.

Gray water is the waste generated from faucets, showers and laundry machines — water that accounts for 54.2% of all water used inside a home, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. With California deep into a drought, in August 2008 I retrofitted the plumbing on my laundry machine to send its gray water onto my landscape. Over the last two years, that simple switch has sent 9,720 gallons to passion fruit vines instead of the sewer, and it required only one change to my usual routine. I had to swap laundry detergents because my usual brand, like many, contained salt and other ingredients that kill plants.

Jacques Clouseau in "The Pink Panther" (1963): Just to be clear -- this is genius-level idiocy. That's because Peter Sellers was a genius, and his portrayal of the bumbling Clouseau is practically a master's class in comedic acting. Sequels and remakes and all that (avoid the Steve Martin versions), but this is the place to start.

My palate has changed over the years, and I now prefer a less oaked or totally unoaked chardonnay. I found the Avant to be delicious and much more to my liking. Wine Enthusiast liked it too, giving the wine 90 points. While I could taste the oak, it was quite mild. The wine was fermented in a combination of neutral oak barrels and stainless steel tanks. Although it also has a 13.5 percent alcohol level, it was not as big and fruity as the Vintner's Reserve. Instead it was bright and crisp, with the fresh flavor of green apples and citrus with some tropical fruit notes. This wine has good structure, a refreshing acidity and a nice clean finish. The Avant would work both as an aperitif and as a pair with shellfish and lighter foods.

We wanted the full experience. A diverse group — Al and Jack, retired businessmen; Davis, a gallery owner; Daniel, an artist, and me, a writer. We were linked by our enjoyment of the outdoors, by our ages — mid- to late-60s — and by a desire to defy frailty of one sort or another. We figured we would be ready for Yosemite after months of hiking in the mountains of northern New Mexico where we all live. By departure time, we had convinced ourselves that we'd overtrained and began studying maps of Yosemite to see how we might extend each day's hike. Our wives listened quietly. If any of them were thinking, "No fools like old fools," they kept it to themselves.

Both kung-fu icons are relaxed and funny (Jet Li has a full-on laughing fit at one point, which is bizarre if you've only ever seen him glare), and they have surprisingly good on-screen chemistry. Even better, they fight each other, in a long scene choreographed by the legendary Woo-ping Yuen -- and it's clever enough that you almost forget to grieve for what might have been if they'd only done this 15 years sooner.

Ravens DT Haloti Ngata vs. Jets C Colin Baxter: Regular center Nick Mangold isn’t expected to play, so he’ll be replaced by Baxter, a rookie.

“Keep winning games,” he said when asked his goal as the season moved into September. “I’d like to see us win a lot of games — run off a good streak where we could play a lot of those (bench) guys. We can win some more. We definitely want to win the division and have the best record.”
April 2: Bing is released from the hospital more than a week after surgery; he plans to remain out of office for weeks.
I will be thankful for people who run a little late for work.
Is Stern really concerned about the well being of college basketball? Possibly. But another reason for his advocating the change could be that the extra year would have players slightly more ready for the NBA after two seasons of college ball, and owners could get away with getting an extra year of quality play out of players while paying them a rookie-scale salary.
For that reason, among others, I'm grateful for the publication of "The FSG Book of Twentieth-Century Latin American Poetry," which thoughtfully gathers selected works of these relatively familiar names, along with many deserving lesser-known ones. Handsomely printed and designed, the collection has been astutely edited by Ilan Stavans, the prolific author and Amherst College professor who has done as much as anyone alive to bridge the hemisphere's linguistic gaps, and it boasts an all-star lineup of translators. In addition to Stavans they include W.S. Merwin, Richard Wilbur, Lysander Kemp, James Merrill, Robert Bly, Samuel Beckett and Ursula K. Le Guin. Many of the English-language versions that appear here, alongside the originals, are as good as we're likely to get for some time, perhaps ever.
While fiction judges focused on lesser-known authors, the poetry panel selected some of the biggest names in the field, including the 82-year-old Rich ("Tonight No Poetry Will Serve: Poems 2007-2010"), Carl Phillips ("Double Shadow") and Yusef Komunyakaa ("The Chameleon Couch"). The other finalists were Nikky Finney's "Head Off & Split" and Bruce Smith's "Devotions."

David Robinson, a financial adviser at RTS Private Wealth Management in Phoenix, said he uses annuities for some clients and in some cases, but never for the bulk of a person's portfolio. With annuities, investors receive a steady, reliable stream of income but at a cost: Their money is tied up.
But attention must be paid, if only because 15 percent of all vice-presidential nominees since 1900 have wound up in the Oval Office. And Romney has emphasized that his search will be meticulously weighty. In his words the other day, Team Mitt will "go through the kind of vetting and review process that you have to go through to make sure whoever you select will pass the evaluation that's required by the American people." (Translation: We're not going to take a flyer at the eleventh hour and serve up a Sarah Palin.)
A month later, more shareholders voiced their objections at the company's annual meeting.
"One district ... is more than 32,000 square miles," Murphy said. "Given the 26 percent cut legislators have already taken in salary and benefits, and the 15 percent additional cut the speaker made to the Assembly operating budget, today's action seems punitive, and not in line with the commission's duty to size legislative compensation to the job."
"We get pressure every year to extend the harvest season," said Frank W. Dawson III, an assistant secretary at the Maryland Department of Natural Resources. "We're pleased that they have had the fortitude to stick with what we think is a really science-based decision."
"It astounds me," she said. "He influenced thousands of kids. He was a dedicated teacher and coach."
White, it turns out, had just enough kick in the end. A year after completing his geology and earth science degree at Eastern Michigan, he has been concentrating on running while volunteering as a coach for EMU's women's track team. He cleans an office building at night, wakes early for his own training, and paces women runners later in the day.

Soediro came back a few days later with some Barbie dolls. When she returned a third time, the girls showed her a stack of miniature dresses, sarongs and shirts.
I was wondering if it is possible to trade players for draft picks in the MLB. I know this kind of exchange happens frequently in the NBA and NFL but I can't recall ever seeing such a trade happen in baseball. On the subject of trades, does Gordon Beckham have any trade value whatsoever at this point in his career? Alex Turner, Chicago
Friem said Metro faced challenges raising the money for pay for expanded service. Among them are the inability to raise local money to match federal funds and little state support of transit in Missouri, he said.
Wine pairing: With plenty of aioli, the artichoke can be accompanied by a bolder red such as Cabernet Sauvignon. With less, choose a Cabernet Franc from France's Chinon.
"It is necessary to replace a 6' section of 30" TL (transmission line) 132 due to a longitudinal weld defect," reads an Oct. 31, 1988, document estimating the cost of putting in new pipe where the leak was found, near Bunker Hill Drive and Interstate 280.

``Small contributors can make a difference in some elections, but big contributors make a big difference,'' Cynthia Canary, director of the reform group, said in a written statement accompanying the study. ``Because contributors help influence policy and laws, the public should pay attention not only to what candidates say but also to the sources of funds.''

The report also referred to the Titanic, which sank in the North Atlantic in the early morning of April 15, 1912. The researchers called the Titanic an exception to their findings, mainly because its captain, Edward Smith, threatened to shoot men unless they yielded to women for lifeboat seats. Capt. Smith went down with his ship.
"From what I hear," Green says, "on the next level -- and every other level of basketball -- it's not the same. That's why I stick around the locker room. I know I have to take advantage of it, because soon it'll be over."
Wage cuts for police officers and firefighters and further reductions to the citys struggling bus system are among the biggest cutbacks proposed today in Detroits 2012-2013 budget, as city officials work to meet terms of a consent agreement that requires them to balance the budget and begin to pay off long-term debt.

An independent review, conducted by a forester with the Forest Service in Oregon, upheld the findings of agency officials in California. While his Dec. 16 report cites "likely" underestimates of the incense cedar harvested, Steven R. Nelson found no mistakes made by Plumas National Forest officials.
Whether I'm overnighting in nearby Aspen or in downtown Denver for a weekend getaway with my girlfriends — shopping, spa-ing, drinking way too much wine, eating out and sleeping in — my husband and kids are happily bonding over carbohydrates and cartoons at home. With pizza and ice cream on the dinner menu, they can watch a marathon of "The Simpsons" in peace without my "What a stupid show" commentary. Everybody wins!
All the gang is here at their unrelentingly cheerful best in this newly released companion to the 40-year-old "C Is for Cooking." Oscar's got a really rotten banana bread, Zoe's hawking breakfast jam cake, Bert's mad for sausage pockets with tomato dipping sauce. Simply styled photos show the kids what the finished recipe should look like, while illustrations of their favorite characters act as cheering squad and jokesters, "The messier, the better!" says Oscar about the messy green stuff in a potato crust. Although a tips page that breaks down tasks by age includes things a 2-year-old can do, most of the recipes are geared toward the older set, about 7 or 8 and older.
The conceit is that the characters aren’t falling in love with individuals; they’re couples falling in love with each other as a unit. You would think this would at least make for some interesting hanky-panky, and you do get a foursome in which they roll around in flour together, which seems to be a new twist.
To showcase that sense of community, Tarpaga invites participants to take part in his family celebrations. In the classroom, Americans on the trip learn West African dance, such as kassena, an ancient warrior dance, and djembe percussion alongside students from Burkina Faso. The mixture allows for moments of cultural dialogue that couldn't possibly be planned.

"Every year's a different year," said Fennoy, whose team was second at state last season. "We just want to get through the year and stay healthy. That's No. 1. There's not a significant difference between the other four teams (East, West, Edwardsville and O'Fallon). There's just no difference between the schools.
GATHER YOUR CHANGE: The coins lying under couch cushions, in pants pockets and at the backs of drawers can add up to tens or even hundreds of dollars. So gather them up and you might be surprised how much you have.
Hey, you'd be crazy to doubt the guy. But surely it won't be as easy as he made it sound on Friday. He has major surgery and a ton of work ahead of him, and even if it all goes well, you would have to think the injury would take some type of toll, especially at such an advanced baseball age.
George Washington hopes to have another title to celebrate in June.
If election officials verify that enough valid signatures were turned in, the council will have the option of allowing the public vote or passing a smoking ban itself.

The Freeholders don't have authority to call for flags to be flown at half-staff, so the resolution asks only that residents display their flags in Montes De Oca's memory.
(It can also be as bleak and slushy as Cleveland in March, but we won't go there.) This year's National Cherry Blossom Festival, which runs March 29 to April 13, falls a bit after most schools' spring breaks, which is good news for bargain hunters. Besides, you may get lucky: The average peak day for blossoms is April 4, according to the National Park Service, but it can come as early as mid-March. For younger kids: The annual White House Easter Egg Roll will take place Monday, March 24, on the South Lawn, but be prepared to camp out overnight for tickets (for details: 202-456-7041 or www.whitehouse.gov).

Neighbor Wayne Hardin told the Associated Press that he never saw the youngest children and was unaware so many people were living in the house.
Bochy, the manager, kept pushing the right buttons but never gloating. And refreshingly, throughout the process, you never heard anybody utter the traditionally lame clichés of false sports victimhood -- "Nobody believed in us" or "We showed the doubters." Instead, you got answers such as this one from Wilson when he was asked why his beard was so unnaturally black: "I don't know what you're talking about -- it's dark because we play a lot of day games. It's tanned. It's focused."
EDITOR'S NOTE: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that some of Cunningham's remarks were made in the House of Representatives. All of her remarks were made in the Senate. This version has been corrected.

Ishmaa’ily Kitchen, Kent State, DT: A Youngstown, Ohio native, Kitchen is one of two Kent State players to sign with the Ravens, joining center Chris Anzenvino who was his college roommate. At 6-foot-1, 335 pounds, he is a classic two-down run defender with the size to clog the middle. He started six games at nose tackle in his senior season, making four tackles against Alabama. The Ravens were thin on the defensive line but they added several during and following the draft and Kitchen faces an uphill battle to make the team.
"The investigation is continuing," Holton said. "We're firmly committed to figuring out who did this and why, and bringing the perpetrator to justice."

In rehearsal, Severn River Middle School student Gabe Needle was a major scene stealer, strong in the role of White Rabbit, dashing about to complex choreography because he's "late, late for a very important date."
Sandwiches come with a choice of fries, cole slaw or potato salad. Pick the homemade potato salad. It's a creamy concoction with snippets of fresh chives, a few sweet peas and just enough mayo to bind and add ample creaminess without suffocating the elements. It was church-social worthy. The slaw is fresh and very lightly dressed — the way I like it. If you like slaw sweet, you may want to pass.

Roberts’ twin, Isaiah, plays basketball for Navy and when Isaiah went south, Jared, after a postgraduate year at the Loomis-Chaffee School in Connecticut, went north.
 When a cheese plate is delivered, it is common to identify the cheeses. We had to ask. What's worse, it was the owner of the bistro who dropped off the "fromage anonymous" with that lousy bread transformed into bad toast. (We had two questions about the goat cheese. What kind was it? And was it infused with herbs to give it that flavor? Our waiter later said it was Cypress Grove "Purple Haze," adding dismissively that it was just straight goat cheese. Wrong answer. You could see little flecks in the cheese, and I found Purple Haze at the Sacramento Natural Foods Co-op; ingredients include fennel pollen and lavender.)
I have two claims to fame: the Ken Hoffman New York Extreme Hot Dog at Minute Maid Park, and the phenomenal Hoffy Burger at Demeris Barbecue. Why would you want to deprive me of what little joy I have? I don't make a penny off either one. I just like to hang out in front of the menu and point.
"Button" gets a boost from two of its cast members, Academy darlings Cate Blanchett and Tilda Swinton. "The Reader" was great not only thanks to Winslet, but also because of Ralph Fiennes, David Kross, and Lena Olin, and a moral complexity that kept you thinking long after the credits. "Milk" will get votes not only because it's a well-crafted tragedy, but because its politics play well with Academy members.
The Aldridge-Love matchup does, however, highlight one of the many debates when the coaches voting is revealed. Many, like Blazers coach Nate McMillan, consider the record of the player's team when making selections.
Whenever we change our coverage in one section it has domino effects elsewhere. Some of our Thursday Outbound coverage will move to the California Traveler section.

I was making dinner and all I really wanted was a fast, filling and easy chicken something-or-other. I was thinking chicken and refried bean burritos, but realized too late that I didn't have any tortillas. Rather than abandon the idea, I went ahead without.

Pombo, who chairs the powerful House Resources Committee, was targeted by the Sierra Club and other environmental groups as an "eco-thug" who once proposed selling off some national parks, led the drive to open Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling, wants to let states drill for oil and gas off their coasts, and has pushed to revamp the Endangered Species Act to provide more rights for property owners.
Spotify was one of the employers, renting out an Austin rooftop to showcase the electronic sounds of Grimes and an Austin coffeehouse to present the rootsy M. Ward.

It's the ninth year for the festival. What goes into deciding what acts will be brought in as headliners? The buck stops here. Every year I look at who's out there and has not been here. I keep looking and researching, to see who would be a good fit. And, from the business side, who the community would respond to.

Before forming the group, Nick appeared in several Broadway plays ("Les Miserables," "Beauty and the Beast," "Annie Get Your Gun") and in a Paper Mill Playhouse production of "The Sound of Music." Joe has also been on Broadway, in the Baz Luhrmann-directed production of "La Boheme."
With every shot on goal by Nashville, Phoenix collapsed a horde of defenders in front of Smith. That's the way the Coyotes play, with a team that has to rely on collective effort. Budget restrictions that come with being owned by the NHL allow no room for high-paid superstars.
It's a good thing you used an intermediary to book your tickets, because it can and should act as your advocate when you're overbilled by 500 Euros. Cheaptickets' $100 certificate is a good start, but I'm not happy with its excuse that Air Europa won't return its calls.
Matheny cited Lohse nearing his fourth trip through the Reds' lineup as a significant factor in his summoning the bullpen. However, he couldn't have anticipated the defensive lapses that followed.

Last year there were so many incidents of people being mauled, you know? I remember how funny I thought it was that the media would act so surprised that a Bengal tiger would maul someone if you got in the cage with it. It just seemed ridiculous. It's a tiger -- of course that's what it's going to do!
Kelly said EPA thinks the Corps should prepare a detailed environmental impact statement for the Port of Morrow project, not limit the review to a relatively simple environmental assessment.

The discussions in Molalla have gained steam just as the nearby Lake Oswego School District considers shutting down three of its elementary schools to save more than $1 million.

Chesnut said that neither she nor anyone on her staff played a role in deciding whether to fund Planned Parenthood.
The classics: They believe in supersizing here. Har gau ($3/4) are among the biggest around. But size comes at a price - in this case, gooey, gummy wrappers. Siu mai ($3/4) arrived haphazardly in the steamer - one was upside down, another on its side. The pork filling is chock-full of shiitakes and shrimp. But you couldn't taste the wrapper; it might as well have been one big meatball instead. Egg custard tarts ($3/3) are very flaky, but greasy.

-- Some derivatives are custom-made to meet a buyer's business needs. Custom derivatives can't be traded on exchanges. This creates a loophole: Derivatives dealers could steer buyers into custom-made contracts, making those trades less transparent.
Those pipes collect sewage and stormwater, making the task daunting and oh, so expensive.
High-tech weaponry and communications satellites also depend on computer networks. Yet the former director of national intelligence, Mike McConnell, told a Senate committee in February: "If we were in a cyberwar today, the United States would lose."
For Treasury, the easiest way to bolster bank balance sheets is to convert the government's existing stake from preferred shares -- a form of debt -- into common shares that carry voting rights. This would help Treasury avoid returning to Congress for more bailout money -- a request lawmakers are likely to rebuff.

Senior-to-be Timothy Wright also has the ability to be a possession receiver. Wright was on track to start opposite of Sanu in 2010 when a preseason knee injury knocked him out for the season. Wright bounced back to haul in 11 catches for 13.4 yards a reception and two touchdowns this year. Two years removed from his injury, Wright should be completely back to form in 2012. He has soft hands and can be a dependable pass catcher.

Set on what must be the most enviable property in Arizona, the resort Auberge de Sedona overlooks a wide, leafy creek with a view of Sedona's iconic red rock mountains behind. Sedona is one of the world's 11 "vortices," or areas with high electromagnetic fields, said to be good for healing and invigorating body and soul. It also has the most startlingly magnificent scenery, surrounded by iron sandstone cliffs, glowing red in the strong sunlight. The newly refurbished L'Auberge de Sedona has a spa giving transcendent treatments such as energy healing, reiki and reflexology. To cleanse and invigorate, visit the Sedona Rouge spa for a hammam spa ritual treatment or a clinical (i.e. real deal) ayurvedic consultation and massage with a therapist who trained under Deepak Chopra. If you were ever going to try something different, this is the place. Just as healing are the silent hikes among those rock cathedrals. When you first hit town, head to the Hike House and take advantage of the free software that maps hundreds of hikes according to terrain and difficulty (and try the Energy Café for trail mix). Then return to the oasis of L'Auberge and order beetroot carpaccio and duck confit in their creekside restaurant.
It’s also worth noting that Marglin’s class is offered specifically as an alternative to the orthodox school of economics that Mankiw embodies. Indeed, Mankiw has criticized Marglin’s class precisely because it criticizes the ideas he teaches. "A main disagreement I have with Steve is pedagogical," Mankiw wrote in his blog on Dec. 10. "I believe his critiques of mainstream economics should be presented after students have had a standard course like ec 10."
Proponents of such collaboration say addressing the complex problem of obesity requires the type of public-private partnership advocated by first lady Michelle Obama in her Let's Move initiative.

Climb to the top of the Hollywood sign or gaze from the skyview seats above home plate at Dodger Stadium or hoist yourself onto the bench atop Runyon Canyon, and the City of Angels spreads her wings to the horizon. The hundreds of neighborhoods melt into a gently rolling forest dotted by skyscraper mountains where even the freeways vanish. This towering view of Los Angeles gives us the great, vast forest perspective in which we are all of one kind (Angelenos) and of one place (Los Angeles), but as with a forest covering a distant mountain, the individual trees — our neighborhoods — are invisible. If we want to know the rich flavors of K-town and Little Ethiopia, WeHo and Chinatown, Van Nuys and Compton, Brentwood, Boyle Heights and all the others, we need to leave the high ground and move into the trees.

Mike Lupica, New York Daily News: "The committee doesn't want too much of this real March Madness stuff, doesn't ever want to end up with two Cinderellas in the Final Four the way it did last year with VCU and Butler making it back, and UConn-Butler becoming one of the worst finals ever. But Missouri wasn't going to win the national championship this year and neither was this Duke team, and so for this one Friday it was just fine seeing the NCAA basketball tournament they are constantly selling you being the one actually being played."

If Quade is the pick, I hope they let him bring in his own bench and base coaches, though Ivan DeJesus did a fine job at third and Bobby Dernier at first the last six weeks and could be brought back. Either Ken Macha or Jerry Manuel would be a decent bench coach, and Quade is friends with both. I'm not sure Ryne would want to coach since his goal is to manage in the majors. I expect Alan Trammell to go to Arizona and be the bench coach for Kirk Gibson, who was his bench coach in Detroit.

Let me tell you about Metropolitan High School. I've done a little bit of work with the charter school on Indy's Westside: a journalism program, a book drive. It's a school filled with kids from challenged backgrounds, kids from disparate communities who have been brought together in the hope they can achieve something better.
Downtown St. Louis is no longer the employment center of the region. Business parks and office buildings have sprouted up all over the metropolitan area. The result is that there is less of a regular flow of commuters in and out of the city than there once was.
Last year, Singh had a pay package of $2.06 million, placing him at No. 82 among CEOs on the list. That's a bargain for a guy who built a company during a decade when the telecom sector seemed moribund and now has Infinera poised for big things.

Like his Cardinals predecessor of 12 to 15 years ago, J.D. Drew, Rasmus seems to have little desire to be a great player.
If The Sun doesn't believe coverage of primary races selecting candidates for a U.S. presidential election is news, what do the editors think is important ("Romney rolling toward the fall," April 25)? There was nothing on Wednesday's front page about the five primaries held the day before. Inside the paper on page 8 was a headline describing Gov. Mitt Romney as "rolling" toward the fall.
SkyEurope was founded in 2001 and began operations in February 2002. It has not been profitable since. It operated services to more than 20 European cities from bases in Bratislava, Vienna and Prague.

I have been ashamed of my choice ever since. He forgave me a million times over but I am still ashamed. While we were both poor, I had kind loving parents while he had been abandoned by his mother and horribly abused by his father. I feel like I was just another person that used him.
The Luck-Griffin comparison has been the topic of conversation of this draft, with many of the most even-keeled talent evaluators in the league wondering out loud if the two can lead the draft's best quarterback class since John Elway led the 1983 group.

Meanwhile, Don's possibly gay teen brother (Mark Oosterveen) has been given a copy of Walt Whitman's "Leaves of Grass" (wink, wink) by an unusually attentive high school librarian (Steven Clarke), whose bow tie, wingtips and pocket hanky seem to hint at his sexual orientation.
Lynn will have to develop some sort of reliable off-speed pitch if he stays in the rotation. He throws hard enough and appears to have confidence but can he handle a lineup the third time through?
O’Dowd, 38, is in charge of dealing with the Legislature. He served as chief of the Securities and Healthcare Fraud unit at the U.S. Attorney’s Office, and has a close personal bond with the governor. Christie recently named O’Dowd’s wife, Mary, as health commissioner.

Missing the deadline would embarrass Gingrich and be another sign that his state-by-state organization has yet to catch up with his campaign's surge.
Doyle fishes and asks why Nucky and him aren't speaking. Jimmy basically tells him that it's none of his beeswax. They discuss the fact that they need more space for their booze but Doyle says there isn't an empty garage within ten miles. Everything is full. Jimmy tells him to try harder and to look within "eleven miles and pay cash."

The war: The United States declares war on Spain after the explosion of the U.S. battleship Maine in Havana harbor in 1898. Historians later say Hearst's many editorials and news stories had an influence on public opinion and government policy in favor of the war.
Despite its monumental run time, "Napoleon" covers only a fraction of its subject's life. It starts with him in 1783 as an intrepid schoolboy leader (played by Vladimir Roudenko) of a snowball fight and ends in 1796, by which time he's become a commanding — in every sense of the word — general (portrayed by Albert Dieudonné) leading France's Army of Italy to victory.

Well, Westmont's Tony Pianto and Prospect's Johnny Ramirez each got their wish last week.
4 We already knew Brad Bird was a wizard, a brilliant animation director whose credits include the classics "The Incredibles" and "Ratatouille." But darn it if he doesn't just keep surpassing himself. Bird made his debut as a live-action director with "Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol," which revived the franchise, boosted Tom Cruise back into the blockbuster spotlight, and impressed critics. On top of everything else, Oregon gets to claim Bird as an almost-native -- he was born in Montana, but grew up in Corvallis. The DVD and Blu-ray release of "Ghost Protocol" includes various special features, including Bird's commentary and several how-they-made-that segments. Available Tuesday; $19.99-$34.99; missionimpossible.com

"It's definitely a mistake that I made when I was younger, not something I was proud of," he said. "It's not something that's prevented me from doing the things I needed to do in my life. Without question, I'm a more responsible person as a result of the experience."

Not all the responses were so positive:
That state, like California, has a three-strikes law, and Abaire had a history of petty theft violations. So he's being charged with a third-degree felony punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine.

He immediately takes pressure off his young players by telling them that since they are expected to win, if they fall short it’s his fault — he didn’t get them to buy in, he didn’t maximize their talent, he didn’t have the right gameplan.
"I prefer Weeden at 22 or 37 to Tannehill at #4. Weeden is ready now, has a stronger arm, is better suited (build-wise) for the AFC North and has more experience as a QB. I think you have to look to fill a void at #4. The voids are RT, RB, WR. One of those really has to be the priority at #4. If H&H don't love T Rich, Kalil or Blackmon at #4 they should trade down.

Many, many men don’t like pubic hair at all. If you’re one of them, it’s time for a little quid pro quo.
“Oh, absolutely. There’s no question in my mind he can be rattled,” he said. “I don’t care who you are as a quarterback. If you take shots from the blind side, you start to worry. There’s no question he can be rattled — Baltimore did it a couple of weeks ago. And the Giants have done it to him as well.”
The Board of Elections supports the petition to conduct a new election for office, according to a letter dated July 6 and filed by the state Attorney General’s office on behalf of the board.
"Commissioner Cerf has never hidden the fact that he has two homes in the state that he has one in Montclair and that he has one in Montgomery, very akin to how people have a home up north and a shore house," Christie insisted. "He got this in an attempt to shorten his commute from day to day."

Inspectors found flaws with the incident alarm-response systems at the three prisons because there was no audible alarm. At La Palma and Florence, they found malfunctioning and out-of-focus security cameras.
Maryland's restrictions on carrying a handgun outside the home have been among the strongest in the nation — and for good reason, given the death and destruction perpetrated by those possessing handguns in this state. So it is regrettable that the standard is now under threat because a federal judge, emboldened by a pair of recent Supreme Court decisions that have expanded the reach of the Second Amendment, has found a portion of the law unconstitutional.
This is the second major event announced for Bader Field Airport, which, after hosting the Dave Matthews Band Caravan last year, is shaping up as a prime destination for touring acts looking for lots of space. Earlier this winter, metal favorites Metallica announced the Orion Music and More, an eclectic multi-stage event they're co-creating; that, too, will be held on the Bader Field site. Just as Dave Matthews did at his own destination event, Metallica will headline each night of the Orion Fest. Orion is slated for June 23 and 24 -- a week after the Phish shows.
The installation by Porterfield, creator of the independent film "Putty Hill," takes up one wall, where six dozen 20-by 30-inch cellphone pictures form a large quiltlike work. On the opposite wall is a monitor showing a video montage of the same pictures and additional ones.
A: It never quite works out that way. What happens is I'm lucky that there's like a firewall in my brain between these projects. In the last week I've worked on something about rock and roll in the late '60s, a Russian guy poisoned with polonium in London a couple of years ago, the Rosenberg case and something set in a Tasmanian penal colony in 1820. While you're in that world, you're in that world.
Some numbers to consider: The 2011 standard monthly premium for Medicare Part B is $115.40, assuming that you and your husband together make $170,000 or less annually. (If your joint income exceeds $170,000, you'll pay more.) It also matters whether the premium is withheld from your Social Security check; see details at the Center for Medicare Advocacy's website at http://www.medicareadvocacy.org (click on "Info by Topic" to find Medicare Part B information).
Thus I get seriously choked up when I hear Annakin Slayd’s “Remember,” his tribute to his hometown team, which shrewdly samples “Gathering Crowds.” Montreal doesn’t have a ballclub anymore: The Expos, who I always had a soft spot for, have moved south to Washington, where they’re drafting high and hoping for the best. Annakin Slayd is a sports-rapper (he also does a song about the Montreal Canadiens, which, less imaginatively, samples “Don’t Stop Believin’’) who probably grew up when I did. I’m sure he remembers the pre-ESPN era, and I imagine that his relationship to his club was mediated by the same forces that shaped mine: staticky radio, Topps picture cards, shoddily written preview issues in fly-by-night magazines, Games of the Week on television, and occasional golden trips to the ballpark. The Expos never won anything, but their near-misses – many of which are inscribed in Slayd’s verse – are part of Canadian baseball lore. They were in first place when the 1994 strike wiped out the rest of the season. A rap about a ballclub might sound silly to those with no passion for the horsehide, but he doesn’t have to explain a thing to me. The pain in this song is as real as The Game, or Leonard Cohen, or “Everybody Hurts.”
"When people ask you what this election is about, you tell them it is still about hope. You tell them it is still about change," he said. It was a rebuttal to Romney’s campaign, which has lately taken to mocking Obama’s 2008 campaign mantra as "hype and blame."
The indictment against Zapata Espinoza was returned by a grand jury on April 19 and unsealed Wednesday.
The instant Stevie jukebox continues, as Cohen touts another ballad, "Blame It on the Sun," which he associates with his daily walks through the streets of Siena, Italy, where he teaches each summer. Then again, he points out, you can't beat Stevie's "As," from "Songs in the Key of Life," which features Herbie Hancock oozing on Fender Rhodes through Stevie's lift-you-to-the-sky vocals, way back in 1976. That tune "just captures you," says Cohen. "It has everything in it -- very emotional and grooving at the same time. Perfect music."
As I said to my new congregation: We are all on the journey to Bethlehem, and we are blessed to be journeying together.
His meeting with Ackerman led to a joint memo on Nov. 8 to the School District staff, reminding them to take a hard line on bullying and assaults.

To change Mandy's behavior in a positive manner, you have to be home when it happens. The goal is to teach her a different reactive behavior when she hears the neighbor arrive, and you'll want to include your neighbor in the training in order to increase the success.
You need to have the remote control handy, and "if the player is not in the same room as the computer you are working at you should have a pen and paper available." And, "if the player is not in the same location as you, you will need to complete registration another time, from that location."
Last week Linda Feinberg, the assignment judge of Mercer County Superior Court, ruled that state judges and Supreme Court justices are exempt from the increases because of a constitutional provision prohibiting the diminution of their salaries while they are in office.

TRENTON — New Jersey government retirees may have their pension payouts cut if Governor Chris Christie and lawmakers don’t agree on a plan to close a $53.9 billion hole in the system, Senate President Stephen Sweeney said.
"We've run competitively at every venue," Biffle said. "The short tracks we've been pretty respectable. At this point I feel good about improving on all those fronts, just getting a little better than we are now."
"The testimony is somewhat surprising," Mironov said. "It’s really clear that those monies were once collected directly by the towns."

You won't find every film to be memorable; even the most established festival has its share of duds. But sifting for treasure is part of the fun. As TFF's founders have surely learned over the last decade, the risks are always worth taking when the rewards are so great.

Defense is what Mike Brown brought to this team and this town when he was hired to be the Lakers coach. It's not an easy sell. Let's be honest. L.A. isn't a defense kind of town. Defense doesn't twinkle or titillate. Defense generally is as sexy as Santa Claus.
A stock market rally for much of last year and a boost to the housing market from a federal tax credit, now expired, had also helped.
PHOENIX (USA TODAY) — The federal government filed a lawsuit against the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office on Thursday alleging that sheriff's deputies discriminate against Latino residents that the Sheriff's Office retaliates against critics of Sheriff Joe Arpaio.

Pipeline: Ocean meets land on the North Shore of Oahu in a creation of natural perfection – a curving, thundering pipe-shaped wave known around the world. When large enough for a top surfer to ride standing up, it is a marvelous combination of the power of nature and the skill of man. From Ehukai State Park, walk to the left down to the beach. Pipeline is the wave that breaks from your left to your right. The wave breaking the other way is called “Backdoors.”

"I came back strong. Large. Tights and Cape. . ."
With growing understanding that the changes of Alzheimer's disease may be decades in the making, the value of early detection is gaining adherents, said Weiner. The "real game-changer," he says, will be when one of the many experimental therapies under study for Alzheimer's disease succeeds in blocking or reversing its progress. Once that happens, physicians, researchers and insurers will need to figure out who should get the test and at what cost, and who will pay.

In a Reuters/Ipsos poll, 53% of respondents said jobs and the economy were the most important issues when thinking about their choice in the election. That poll showed the race as 47% to 43% for Obama overall. But 45% of respondents said Romney was stronger on jobs and the economy, compared with 43% who said Obama was. It was the only issue on which Romney led.
For the first several weeks of the trial in Providence, my room at the Biltmore Plaza Hotel was on the same floor as the rooms von Bulow and Mrs. Reynolds shared. For several years I had seen the two of them around New York. Although we had never spoken, we had often been at the same parties or in the same restaurants. The first day in the courtroom, von Bulow recognized me but did not acknowledge me. The second day he nodded to me in the men's room. When we met in the corridor on the fourteenth floor of the hotel, he struck up a conversation about a portable word processor I was carrying. At that moment the door to their suite opened, and Andrea Reynolds came out into the hall.

And Sunday gravy is only the beginning -- how about prosciutto souffle, stuffed leg of lamb, veal balls in green sauce, fennel-stuffed chicken, or Sicilian orange and lemon tart? There are hearty, luscious but doable menus for a year of Sundays. It's the gift that keeps giving -- right back to you.
Except that it's new. McCarthy told me he had replaced the old bar's Formica countertop and taken out the fluorescent lighting. And he'd raised expectations by promising an upscale tavern. Though Lighthouse doesn't look like a "liquor store" anymore (his words to describe Sports Cafe), it hasn't settled on a look that is modern or upscale, and so it fails to meet its own standards.
Given limited dollars, Webb said ESCO wanted to spend money on improving controls rather than fenceline monitoring.
"We may well conclude down the line that it doesn't work and a different tack has to be taken, and that will be a very sad day, and a tough day for the region," Annan said.
WASHINGTON -- Any more stimulus spending by President Barack Obama and Congress is dead, after this week's election blowout by the Republicans. Yet, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's "Hail Mary" pass to pump $600 billion into the banking system is really stimulus spending under another name.

An Oct. 28 report by the inspector general’s office of the federal transportation department found that persistent delays at Newark, JFK and LaGuardia have a ripple effect on on-time performance nationwide. The report urged the FAA to address the delays, which were blamed on the high volume of air traffic in the region — the nation’s busiest — and unrealistically high limits on the number of hourly landings and takeoffs.
"Subsidies for solar and wind power also have environmental downsides and, at any case, are government interference in the market," he said.
The 74-year-old activist investor is well-known for taking on corporate executives and taking apart companies from TWA to RJR Nabisco. He built his reputation with sharp elbows, not friendly dialogue, and rarely hesitates to take his corporate critiques public.

“We like using all of our picks,” he said. “We’ve moved up to get guys before and it hasn’t worked out great for us before so we’re a little bit leery of moving up to take guys. We’ve done that in the past and I don’t think our success has been very good doing that.”

In 1946, she met and married her husband of 65 years, Allen G. Castner, a decorated World War II Army Air Corps veteran and B-17 bomber pilot.

"The best judge of whether our beers are good or not is the local consumer," said Dan, who worked at a London brewery called Young's back in the '80s. The brewery won a bunch of awards -- and still closed down.
This franchise must know that it has work to do. It needs a mental adjustment. It needs to do some soul searching. Forget more talent. It needs to recognize that adding the toughness of Wallace and Wesley Matthews, and making moves at the NBA trade deadline, got it no closer to the second round than it was 12 months ago.
"You need to be able to communicate; you need to be able to consult," Hayden said. "I believe it is impossible for us to effectively represent Mr. Williams. It is with profound regret that I make this motion."

The city paid Pinnacle $370,000 for the barge - a leftover from the Admiral's Six Flags era - and will spend about $200,000 to renovate it as a floating theater and outdoor stage across the Ohio River from downtown Louisville, Ky., said Clarence Hulse, Jeffersonville's economic development director.
"It was 'Whoosh,' and they were gone," she said. "But it was exciting, and people are looking forward to it again."
Even the word "leftovers" carries the negative connotation of the unwanted, the uneaten, the scraps.
Careful though, while all of that was going on, Florida State was boiling up a caldron full of Nelson Potion that may have just swung the 6-foot-2, 180-pound phenom. And surely after the Seminoles beat the pants off the Irish, well, sorta, Agholor would never pick Notre Dame. Right?
"The experience was overwhelming," Qadhi said. "It was a very moving experience for all of us imams, in particular myself. I had never seen anything like this.

A: Multitasking. We are supposed to be doing something useful every moment of the day. My Buddhist teachers say the only time Americans don't do something is when they are on the passenger side of a car, and that's not even true anymore. We always have to be doing one, two or three things at once. But it's not efficient. Where our brilliance comes from is a relaxed mind. From a Buddhist point of view, if you don't know how to do nothing, you don't know how to do anything properly or fully.

I am tired of the hawks' view that every Middle Eastern episode of tension can be solved by military force. True, Iran has said it would "wipe Israel off the map." But this talk — absurd on the face of it — sounds like the posturing of a street corner punk. Iran surely knows that any attack on Israel would be suicidal because Israel could strike back with overwhelming military force, and perhaps with nuclear weapons.

Ohio privacy laws have not been substantially updated since the 1970s, leaving very little protection for residents. Technology has far outpaced our laws, and issues that were never considered 40 years ago now pose serious threats to our personal freedom. In the 1970s, personal computers and the Internet were in their infancy, while cell phones, smart phones and laptops were nearly unimaginable. Additionally, most people could not anticipate the amount of data aggregation used today and the availability of our most private information with a few keystrokes.

But as Goldman Sach's CEO Lloyd Blankfein said on PBS earlier this month: "You will not absolutely rule out excess.

Now that Tressels gone, he becomes a toxic dump. Every alleged impropriety that emerges from future media exposes and public revelations gets tossed atop his coaching grave. Tressel became Ohio States most valuable trump card as the stench of impropriety worsened. The school knew the NCAA would eventually demand a prominent head on a platter.
Sure, that's not an endorsement suburban grocers, such a as Heinen's, would welcome. But this ain't Hudson.

But that was before the Lakers went cold and dropped five games in a row, including 93-86 to the Blazers last week. Maybe a Portland-Los Angeles first-round playoff matchup doesn't sound so scary anymore. Or maybe it still does. So we're asking the question again: Who do you want to face in the playoffs? And specifically, how would you describe your feelings about a Blazers-Lakers first-round series?

Her time in that event was four-tenths of a second slower than the state record she set last year. Franklin also set a state record in the 100 freestyle (48.45) in her leadoff leg on the 400 freestyle relay Friday. Franklin swam the anchor leg on that third-place relay team Saturday and also swam the backstroke leg on Regis Jesuit's second-place medley relay team.

"Dark Shadows" opens promisingly, downshifts after 30 minutes, and sputters into a meandering, momentum-free mess. Depp plays Barnabas Collins, the brooding bloodsucker who debuted in Dan Curtis' horror-tinged TV soap opera in 1966. An atmospheric prologue sets up his tragic dilemma. The heir of an 18th-century Maine fishing fortune, he rejects the advances of serving girl Angelique (Eva Green). The beauty reveals herself as a witch, kills Barnabas' true love, Josette (Bella Heathcote), transforms him into a vampire and buries him in a padlocked casket.

The missing octopus aside, Kyma delivered quality Greek, one food I can never get enough of. Prices are reasonable; none of those $45 lamb chops you might find elsewhere. The arni paidakia or lamb chops here ($28) are marinated in olive oil, lemon and fresh herbs and served with potatoes sto fourno (garlic lemon potatoes) and tzatziki. You may wish the four chops were bigger or more numerous, but they were expertly cooked (medium rare) and bursting with flavor.
State funding is a big question. The district annually receives about $6.9 million from Missouri. Because the enrollment is lower, the district expects a loss of funds. Part of the state funding formula uses enrollment to determine the amount.

“The thing with (Tebow) is you have to stay disciplined,” safety Jim Leonhard said. “Because as inconsistent as he is throwing the football, all of a sudden he’ll make a throw where you look at it and go, ‘Wow, that was impressive.’ And for the most part, those throws have been touchdowns. They’re a big-play, fast-strike offense when you throw the ball down the field, so you have to stay honest with your eyes and play good technique, or else they’re going to hurt you.”

In other words, hands off those carts stocked with soaps and lotions. Those are meant for someone else's room. "I know someone obsessed with hotel shampoo and soap, and he even stalks the housekeeping carts to steal handfuls," says Marianne Cushing, a vice president for an ad agency in Fort Myers, Fla. "I told him I think he has a problem and needs to seek professional help." I agree with her -- raiding the cart crosses the line. There's a reason why each hotel room gets just one set of toiletries, as opposed to a bucket full of soap containers.

• Five things to take from Lakers' 103-92 win over Trail Blazers -- Mark Medina, L.A. Times: The Lakers should complain to the media every 1 1/2 weeks. That way they'll play inspired basketball with lots of energy. That was evident in the team's ball movement; the Lakers cracked the 100-point mark for the fifth time this season and assisted on 18 of the 30 field goals. That was evident in the body language teammates showed after each basket, ranging from high fives, finger pointing and smiles. That was evident in the aggressiveness as the Lakers outrebounded Portland, 42-27.

A Star-Ledger analysis finds that while taxes did go up last year for most, homeowners paid an average of just 2.4 percent more for property taxes in 2011. That’s the smallest increase in nearly two decades — and a strong indication that Gov. Chris Christie’s push to restrain local levies is getting results.
Both Bank of America Merrill Lynch and U.S. Bankcorp. are financing a $1 billion SolarCity project to place solar panels on military housing across the country.

But the loan program expired before the department and SolarCity could agree on terms.

Once he got to Los Angeles, though, Franco saw that acting — or at least, trying to be an actor — wasn’t an impossibility after all. "Half the city was trying to get into the business," he remembers. "One of my dorm mates even got on a series. I realized, ‘Oh, this is something you can actually pursue. There are practical steps you can take.’ " Franco — who, he says, "was very shy, and scared of failure for a long time" — impulsively decided to give it a shot and dropped out of school.
"You'd think that a guy would show signs of being depressed," said former NFL receiver Tim Brown, the golf tournament's co-host. "The guys who played with him in the group were devastated.

That's the thing that's mind-boggling to everybody."

The rate of the generation credit is different for each company FirstEnergy operates. Illuminating Co. customers have a credit of 4.25 cents per kWh while Ohio Edison customers have a 3.9 cent per kWh credit after the first 1,250 kWh. The reason for that is because the actual rates are slightly different. FirstEnergy will figure each customer's credit by multiplying the number of kilowatt-hours used by these credits - subtracting the resulting amounts from monthly bills.

The Environmental Protection Agency has gotten completely out of control. It has dictated against every source of power this country has that would create enough jobs and energy to help cure our economic problems.

ScienceIndex.com's Neurology category covers the nervous system and its disorders. It currently contains 40,521 articles partly derived from 147 scientific journals. The latest articles in this category are also available through a Neurology Sciences RSS feed. One of the latest additions covers depression and quality of life in monogenic compared to idiopathic, early-onset Parkinson's disease (PD). Depression affected 31% of early-onset PD cases, 21% of late-onset cases, and 44% of manifesting carriers of mutations in PD genes, but was rare in the nonmanifesting carriers (7%) and healthy controls (5%). The authors suggest that the Quality of Life (QoL) and, possibly, overall prognosis of all PD patients can be improved by appropriate attention and treatment for depression, sleep impairments, and anxiety, even if the treatment of the motor problems cannot be further optimized. Another recently published article in this category reviews treatments for diabetic neuropathy. Diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy (DSP) is the most frequent form of diabetic neuropathy and effective disease-modifying treatment is not available beyond the interventions of optimal glycemic control, and possibly lifestyle and risk factor modification. The authors summarize that effective treatments for painful DSP include pregabalin, amitriptyline, duloxetine, venlafaxine, gabapentin, opioids, nitrate sprays, capsaicin, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation.

By the 1980s Legorreta was beginning to find steady work outside Mexico. As a result, he became increasingly interested in exploring what it meant to practice regional architecture on a global scale. At a 1990 symposium on contemporary Mexican architecture held at the Pacific Design Center in West Hollywood, he framed the issue this way: "Is ... authenticity portable? That is the question that every architect who works in a number of different countries, as many now do, must ask."

Billy Wilder's Oscar-winning movie "The Apartment" was a big hit in 1960, but its story - the cynical treatment of young working women by older married men - must have seemed kind of cold for the musical stage. But Neil Simon - who wrote the script for its musical adaptation, "Promises, Promises" - knew what to do. He let the leading man, junior executive Chuck Baxter, spend much of his stage time speaking directly to the audience.

Nothing like that had been seen before, and I saw the possibility of a novel in it, but never got started on anything. Over the years, I read Ulysses S.

So there was plenty of consolation amid consolidation but this battle week seems a thinly disguised gutting of some problem picks from Team Blake, Team Adam, Team Cee Lo and Team Christina. There was little drama in last night's eliminations because by thinking like a ruthless record executive at Universal Republic, the label which will award a recording contract to this season's winner, you could have gleaned who was going home before a note was even discharged, based mostly on appearance, the very thing the Blind Auditions warned us against.

But in the last half of the 20th century, technology played an ever-greater role in the development of wine. California wineries were the leaders in this in the '70s and '80s, spurring an evolution throughout the world.

By developing methods of controlling the temperature of fermentation, for instance, winemakers could now produce wines of ripe, bold character that had structure with some restraint and elegance - regardless of their region's climate.
Dogs learn by experimenting with behaviors that pay off. If jumping on a counter means the animal is going to be rewarded by finding a hamburger it will continue to jump on counters because it was rewarded in the past for doing so. Similarly, if a dog is rewarded every time it lays down in another room when you're preparing meals the dog will learn that laying in that particular spot always pays off. Since dogs engage in behaviors that require the least effort to achieve goals, laying in another room for rewards is much less work than leaping on a counter. Room service, please!

This line of thinking is actually known as "Bennett's hypothesis," a reference to former Education Secretary William Bennett, who complained in 1977 that federal aid enabled universities "blithely to raise their tuitions." It's disputed, but there is some evidence to support it.

And Andrew Gillen, research director at the Center for College Affordability and Productivity, released a report in February arguing that there is a link between tuition increases and education subsidies for middle-class and wealthy families (e.g., tuition tax credits).
